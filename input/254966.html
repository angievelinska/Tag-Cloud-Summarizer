<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>A publication synchronizes the state of the <em>Live Server</em> with the state of the <em><span class="inlineformat--contentmanageserver">Content Management Server</span>.</em> All actions such as setting up new versions, deleting, moving or renaming files, withdrawing content from the live site require a publication to make the changes appear on the <em>Live Server</em>.</p><p>We make a distinction between the publication of structural and of content changes:</p><ul><li><p>Content-related changes are changes in document versions such as a newly inserted image, modifed links, text etc.</p><p/></li><li>Structure-related changes are moving, renaming, withdrawing or deleting of resources. So it becomes possible to publish structural changes separately from latest and approved document versions.</li></ul><p>For every publication a number of changes is aggregated in a change set. This change set is normally composed in the course of a publication workflow. The administrator and other users with appropriately configured editors can also execute a direct publication, which provides a simpler, although less flexible means of creating a change set.</p><p/></div><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p><strong>Withdrawing Publications and Deleting Resources</strong></p><p>There is only one fundamental difference between withdrawal of publications and deletion: an withdrawal affects only the <em>Live Server</em>, whereas the deletion of a resource causes the resource to be moved into the trash folder on the <em><span class="inlineformat--contentmanageserver">Content Management Server</span></em>. Contrary to versions of the <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia SCI</span> before 4.2, folders are no longer destroyed, but enter the recycle bin in the same manner as documents.</p><p>Before a withdrawal or deletion can be published as described before, a mark for withdrawal or for deletion must be applied using the appropriate menu entries or tool bar buttons. In the case of folders, the contained resources are affected, too. If you have marked a resource for deletion and withdrawal, then the deletion will be executed.</p><ul><li>When a folder is marked for deletion, all contained published resources are marked for deletion, too. Not published resources are immediately moved into the recycle bin without requiring to start a publication.</li><li>When a folder is marked for withdrawal, all contained published resources are marked for withdrawal, too.</li><li>When a mark for withdrawal or deletion of a folder is revoked, this also affects all contained resources with the same mark.</li><li>If you use direct publication and approve a folder that is marked for withdrawal deletion, that approval is implicitly extended to the contained resources that are also marked for withdrawal or deletion.</li><li>Disapprovals extend to contained resources in the same way.</li></ul><p/></div><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p class="p--heading-1"><strong>Change Set in Direct Publications</strong></p><p>When performing a direct publication, the change set is primarily based on the set of currently selected resources or on the single currently viewed resource. As the set of resources does not give enough information for all possible types of changes, three rules apply:</p><ul><li>You cannot publish movements and content changes separately. Whenever applicable, both kinds of changes are included in the change set.</li><li>When a document is marked for deletion or for withdrawal, new versions of that document are not published.</li><li>If the specific version to be published is not explicitly selected, the last approved resource version is included in the change set.</li></ul><p>There are also some automated extension rules for the change set, which modify the set of to-be-published resources itself. These rules can be configured in detail. Ask your Administrator about the current settings.</p><ul><li>When new or modified content is published and links to an as yet unpublished resource, the unpublished resource is included in the change set. Depending on the configuration, also recursively linked documents can be included in the change set.</li><li>When the deletion of a folder is published, all directly and indirectly contained resources are included in the change set.</li><li>When the withdrawal of a folder is published, all directly and indirectly contained published resources are included in the change set.</li><li>When the creation, movement, or renaming of a resource in an unpublished parent folder is published, that folder is included in the change set.</li></ul><p/></div><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p><strong>Preconditions</strong></p><p>Preconditions for a successful publication are:</p><ul><li>all path information concerning the resource has to be approved too: if the resource is located in a folder never published before, this folder has to be published with the resource. So, add it to the change set or publish the folder before.</li><li>withdrawals and deletions must be approved before publication.</li><li>all documents linked to from a document which is going to be published have to be already published or included in the change set. This is because a publication that would cause dead links will not be performed.</li><li><p>a document which is going to be deleted must not be linked to from other documents or these documents have to be deleted during the same publication.  </p><p/></li></ul><p/><p/></div><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p/><table class="WIDTH_1--55 WIDTH_2--45"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><strong>Status and action on the</strong> <strong><span class="inlineformat--contentmanageserver">Content Management Server</span></strong></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><strong>Effect on the <em>Live Server</em> on publication </strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>A version of the document does not yet exist on the <em>Live Server</em>.
