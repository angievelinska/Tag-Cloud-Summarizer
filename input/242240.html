<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>The use of the <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS</span> covers a range from sites maintained by a single editor to very large portals edited by many users in different roles. The more users are involved in editing, approving and publishing documents, the more difficult it becomes to coordinate tasks and schedules. Computer support can greatly enhance productivity because the users do not have to deal with organizational issues too much. </p><p>This goal can be achieved by introducing workflows. These workflows do not precisely prescribe how tasks have to be performed, but coordinate and support the timely execution of different tasks by different users with as much flexibility as possible and as necessary. The CoreMedia Workflow has a non-restrictive, supportive approach - CoreMedia users are given access to the right resources at the right time via tasks. In contrast to restrictively controlling users, CoreMedia Workflow focuses on progress of the overall business processes.</p><p>The <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS</span> is delivered with some standard workflows which control content publication. They are based on the inherent state model of <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS</span> resources (see the User Manual, Basic Knowledge). While the simplest workflow publishes a set of resources immediately, the most complex one ensures that composing the set of resources, approving those resources and the actual publication are executed explicitly by different users. </p><p>If these workflows do not fit your needs, you can define your own workflows. A workflow basically consists of a set of tasks which are processed in a specific order (usually linear, but also circles and branches are possible) and a set of variables which represent the state of the workflow. There are automated tasks which are processed automatically at their turn (like publishing some resources) and user tasks which have to be handled explicitly by a user (e.g. composing a set of resources to be published). </p><p>The tasks and variables of a workflow are defined in XML. The <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS</span> provides some content related standard actions you can choose from to inspire your tasks, but you can also implement your own actions. You can specify performer policies to prevent or enforce users to process a task.</p><p>From the technical point of view, processing a task means executing some actions but also changing workflow variables. For user tasks the <em>CoreMedia Editor</em> and the <em>CoreMedia WebEditor</em> support this in a fashion similar to editing the properties of a resource. And just alike, you might want to use special editing components for restrictions or convenience. Thus introducing custom workflows usually includes some Editor customizing.</p><p>See the <em>Workflow Developer Manual</em> for details. </p></div>
