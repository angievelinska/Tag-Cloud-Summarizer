<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p><em>CoreMedia CMS </em>offers different APIs and frameworks for the creation of custom clients. </p><ul><li>The <em>Unified API</em> which enables you to implement custom <em>CoreMedia CMS</em> clients from scratch. Taking over session handling and remote communication, it reveals the full functionality of the <em>Content Server</em> and the <em>Workflow Server</em> in a convenient and intuitive abstraction which allows you to concentrate on business logic. See the <em>Unified API Developer Manual</em> for details.</li><li>The <em>WebServices Engine</em>, which allows to access the <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS</span> using Web Services. You can use the <em>Unified API</em> or the <em>Content Application Engine</em> to develop your Web Services. See the <em>Delivery Developer Manual</em> for details.</li><li>The <em>WAGE API</em>, which enables you to access the <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS</span> using web based clients. The current <em>WebEditor</em> is an implementation of the <em>WAGE API. </em>Read the <em>WAGE Developer Manual</em> for details. You should only use the <em>WAGE API</em> for customization of the <em>WebEditor</em> or if you need workflow functionality in your clients but not for newly designed stand-alone clients. For this tasks use the more modern <em>Editing Services for JSF</em>.<em> </em> </li><li><em>Editing Services for JSF</em>, a framework which allows to create custom clients to access the CoreMedia repository. It is the successor of the <em>WAGE API</em> and offers many convincing advantages. <span class="inlineformat--editingservice">ES</span> offers for example UI components and reusable beans. It uses modern technology like JSF and Spring and builds on the <em>Unified API</em> and <em>CAE</em>. The Portal Server Integration uses <span class="inlineformat--editingservice">ES</span>  to add editing functionality to portals. Read the <em>Content Application Developer</em> Manual for details.</li></ul><p>The <em>Unified API</em> replaces the <em>Scripting API</em> which you might know from <em>CoreMedia SCI 4.2</em>. Old Scripting clients are still supported with <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS 2005</span>, but for new implementations the usage of <em>Scripting API</em> is deprecated. That is why the <em>Scripting API</em> is no longer documented in the developer manuals. Consult the SCI 4.2 manual for maintenance of your legacy Scripting clients.</p></div>
