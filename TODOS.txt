Project Ideas
--------------
1. At the first login to DocMachine, a cloud with the most popular tags is displayed.
2. I need to have a website as a frontend, where to enter any search strings, and display my results and Tag cloud.


Project TODOs
--------------
1. Investigate how to build a web-app with Maven3 (and add in the report why you are using web-based application, and not swing-based for example).
2. Package the app as a jar, start by starting a webapp server, deploying it, opening a browser...
3. fix the warnings and errors displayed by sonar: mvn org.codehaus.sonar:sonar-maven3-plugin:2.2:sonar -DskipTests=true
4. install Oracle XE on personal laptop, test serverimport
6. Skip creating the input files, parse text from DocMachine directly into a single file used for LSA.
Next step will be to parse texts from DocMachine directly into LSA.
7. Research what can be done for scalabiilty and performance - should txts be parsed in a file, or used from memory?
Research how parallelism can be implemented if txts are parsed in-memory. Describe this in the report.
8. Maven + webapp + tagcloud.jsp  ???

Questions
-------------
1. How to integrate indexing in Lucene with SVD in LSA? SVD uses a matrix, no indexing, no feedables.

Report
-------------
