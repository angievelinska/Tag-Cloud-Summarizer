Project Ideas
--------------
1. At the first login to DocMachine, a cloud with the most popular tags is displayed.
2. I need to have a website as a frontend, where to enter any search strings, and display my results and Tag cloud.

Project TODOs
--------------
1. Investigate how to build a web-app with Maven3 (and add in the report after why you are using web-based application, and not swing-based for example).
2. Package the app as a jar, start by starting a webapp server, deploying it, opening a browser...
3. fix the warnings and errors displayed by sonar: mvn org.codehaus.sonar:sonar-maven3-plugin:2.2:sonar -DskipTests=true
4. check SVD in lsa - after decomposition there are more than 300 dimensions.
5. install Oracle XE on personal laptop, test serverimport
6. Normalize tokens before LSA - decapitalize

Questions
-------------
1. How to integrate indexing in Lucene with SVD in LSA? SVD uses a matrix, no indexing, no feedables.
