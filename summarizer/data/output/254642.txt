 DocumentType Description Example IntProperty With an <IntProperty>, a field's value must be a whole number. <IntProperty Name="Priority"/> StringProperty Choosing the settings below the maximum number of characters to be entered is limited to 200 as defined in Length. The maximum byte length would be 500 bytes as defined in Utf8Length. The attribute Utf8Length is optional. If you do not use this attribute, the value of the attribute Utf8Weight of the <DocTypes> element will be used to calculate the maximum byte length (=Length * Utf8Weight /100). If you set none of the attributes Utf8Length and Utf8Weight, Utf8Weight=300 will be used (see below for details) to define the byte length. <StringProperty Name="Author" Length="200" Utf8Length="500"/ > DateProperty Such fields display dates and times. Editors for simple input are available <DateProperty Name="Date"/> XmlProperty Whereas for some properties, such as the author, a simple character string is sufficient, an <XMLProperty> specifies an XML document field. XmlProperty requires a Grammar attribute which refers to the DTD or Schema of the content. <XmlProperty Name="Text" Grammar="coremedia-richtext-1.0"/ > BlobProperty 

Especially with graphic data you should take into consideration the later output format in document type definitions . For example, a scanned-in photo with 1200 dpi is suitable for printing, but not for a web page. Scaling images is a complicated business and you should not rely on the rather rudimentary functionality of a browser. Instead, there are two better alternatives.

Use a professional image processing program to adjust graphics optimally to all required sizes and resolutions, and create a field for each required variant of a graphic in the document type, e.g. for

original graphic
online
print, colour
print, black and white
thumbnail

The second possibility is scaling images with the help of JSP templates. Since the result of the execution of the template is stored in the ADS cache, this procedure is also very efficient. <BlobProperty Name="Graphic" MimeType="image/*"/ > LinkListProperty Some documents belong together in terms of content, even if they do not reference each other with internal links in XML texts. For example, images belong to a press report which are not explicitly mentioned in the text as illustrations. The number of images differs from case to case, so that it is not practical to define one field per image in the document type. For such cases there is the <LinkListProperty>, which holds a list of documents. All documents of such a list must be of the same document type as determined with the attribute LinkType, or a subtype of that document type. It is also possible to compute reverse links. <LinkListProperty Name="Images" LinkType="Image"/ >
