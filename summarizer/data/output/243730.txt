Line 1: The properties concerning the workflow with the name "ThreeStepPublication" (as it is defined as the workflow's name in the workflow definition file) are configured.

Line 2- 3: The class that is used when a new process is started. Here a specialized class is used, that suppresses the dialog box for initializing the workflow variables normally popping up. In addition, the selected resources are added to the change set.

Line 4: Herein, you can define with which editor the variables defined in the <InitialClient> and <Client> sections of the workflow definition will be shown. If no property editor is defined, the default editor for the variable type will be used.

Line 5 - 7: In this part, an editor class for viewing the aggregation variable "changeSet" which contains the selected resources is defined. A specialized class for the publication workflows is used, which shows place and content changes concerning the selected resources. 

Line 9 + 18: Here, the variable view for the Compose and Approve task is defined.

Line 10 - 16 and Line 19 - 26: For both tasks, two editor classes are defined, which show the content of the "changeSet" and "publicationResultCodes" aggregation variables. For the "changeSet" variable the same class as for the workflow variable view is used.

Line 28: Here, the variable view for the Publish task is defined.

Line 29 - 31: As described before, an editor class for the aggregation variable "changeSet" is defined.

Line 34 - 35: In this section, the representation of the task and workflow information shown in the workflow list is defined.

Line 36 - 41: Three columns should be shown in the workflow list. For each column, a class must be defined which shows the appropriate information. In the first column, the type of the task is shown. In the second column, the state of the task is shown. In the third column additional information concerning the workflow is shown. The class used for it TaskDataColumn is more generic than the other two classes. Thus, it has to be configure by another class defined in the ComponentFactory element to create the renderers for the column.

Line 42 - 44: In this part, the specialized class for showing details about the publication workflows is defined. The attribute processName defines the workflow for which the information should be shown. See Section 4.4 for details on the class.
