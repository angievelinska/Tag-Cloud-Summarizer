Since CoreMedia CMS 2008, the structure of the CAE web application engine has been optimized to serve the purpose of modular configuration (see section for details). The new structure looks as follows:

WEB-INF/
  +- web.xml         Central configuration of the web application
  +- ..              Additional central configuration e.g. log4j
  +-  lib/
        +- *.jar
        +- *-config.jar
  +- dataviews/      Dataview configuration
        +- *.xml
  +- templates/      JSP-view templates
        +- *.jsp
  +- spring/         Spring custom configuration
        +- *.xml
        +- *.properties
