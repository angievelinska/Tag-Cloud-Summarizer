Apart from the actual server tools we provide some generally useful utilities. You don't need them to run CoreMedia CMS, but nevertheless you might like them.



ior: Shows the content of an IOR in readable format


transform: Transforms an XML document by XSLT


validate: Validates an XML document against its DTD

Since these tools don't access the CoreMedia CMS server, they don't support the standard options.
