The predefined Performance Report (see Performance-Report) displays the aggregated number of page impressions and visits for a given (sub-)site in the selected time interval. 

The following definitions of page impressions and visits are used:

Page Impression: CoreMedia Analytics defines a page impression (PI) as a single play-out of a page to a site visitor.
Visit: In CoreMedia Analytics, a single user web session is counted as one visit.

The diagram's x-axis expands on the time interval given by the time range parameter with ticks (axis marks) according to the time resolution parameter. Each x-axis tick represents a time interval tval  expanding from the given point in time to the next tick, including the left/lower interval boundary and excluding the right/upper one. Each x-axis tick is mapped to the aggregated number of page impressions (shown as a bar) and visits (shown as a line) within the time interval. 

Example: In the detail report view given below, the x-axis tick representing May 2006 starts on 1st of May at midnight and ends on 1st of June at midnight, including the initial point in time but excluding the ending one.
