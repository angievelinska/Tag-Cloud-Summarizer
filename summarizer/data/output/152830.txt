In a portal application there are two types of contents

Page: A document to be presented inside a portlet. It is represented as XML and will be interpreted and transformed on portal side. 
Binary: A content of arbitrary content type, such as a GIF-Image, which has been embedded in a page and won't be processed at portal side. 

A page may contain links to other contents. These link types exist:

Page Link: A link to another page. When clicking the link, the resulting page will be typically displayed in the same portlet.
Binary Link: A link to binary content which will typically embedded the binary into the page. Therefore, binary links won't be clicked by the user.
External Link: An external link may point to any resource in the WWW. When using such a link, the portlet will be left.
Resource Link: A link to a resource which is located in the portal, such as special images used for the portal look & feel.
