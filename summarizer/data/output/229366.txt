The Unified API (UAPI) provides a common, module-independent client API for content, workflow, and user management. In CMS 2005, the UAPI is used in the Content Application Engine (CAE), acts as a supplement for the deprecated Scripting-API, and all server tools have been re-implemented using this API. CMS 2006 enables the use of the UAPI in workflow server actions and in the importer.

In order to also support Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using the UAPI, Editing Services has been created to use the UAPI in user interfaces. So far, the content part of the UAPI is covered by the corresponding Editing Services implementations: For all relevant UAPI content functions, there are GUI Actions / Commands, and for all relevant UAPI content objects (and also collections of these), there are factories to create representations for a localized GUI.

The advantages of a GUI-API based on the Unified API are:

Custom business logic used in imports, workflow actions, or scripting clients can be re-used as-is.
The same initializers and validators can be used e.g. during import and in the GUI. For the GUI, all that is needed are generic adapters to the concrete GUI framework used.
Some configuration of the GUI can be shared between GUIs based on different GUI frameworks.
There is a clear separation of concerns between the business logic, the presentation logic, and the actual presentation (GUI framework), which leads to modular, maintainable code.
