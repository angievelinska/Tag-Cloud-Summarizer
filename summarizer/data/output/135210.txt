The picture above shows the publishing preview of an example web page. The first teaser is highlighted by a blue hovereffect, as the mouse is over it. The user opened a pop-up menu with a right mouse click. It is now possible to open the document in the CoreMedia Editor for editing, to show it in the explorer window, to edit the containing element (the current Page document),  or to get the document information for the Shakira article.
