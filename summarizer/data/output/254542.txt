Adjust the configuration of database connection in sql.properties. The parameters are:

sql.store.driver: This parameter references the JDBC driver of the selected database. The driver is database-specific.
sql.store.url: This parameter gives the URL where the CM Server can reach the database.
sql.store.user: Name of the previously created database user.
sql.store.password: Password of the previously created database user (for more details see Section).
sql.store.dbProperties: This parameter references a database-specific configuration file in the directory ./properties/corem. Configuration files for all supported databases are supplied and contain special information for the particular database. They must not be changed. The default file names are: db2.properties for a DB2 database, mssql.properties for a Microsoft SQL Server and oracle.properties for an Oracle database.

Enter the necessary data. Replace "localhost" with the computer name in sql.store.url where the database is installed. If you are not using an ORACLE database, the other entries also have to be adjusted. Continue with the configuration by clicking [Next].

Now the window for the configuration of the capclient.properties opens up.
