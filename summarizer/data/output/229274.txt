You can use the category filter (the 3rd report parameter) to interactively drill down the repository's category structure:  In the category filter selection box corresponding entries are listed (see screenshot). 

To navigate down the category hierarchy or drill into a subcategory, select a subcategory. The selected subcategory becomes the new current category and the chart visualizes the content item distribution within that category. 


To navigate up the category hierarchy or coarsen your category selection, choose the parent category in the category selection box. The parent category is marked with a minus sign '-'. After updating the report view, the parent category will become the new current category and the former current category will be shown as one of many pie sections.
