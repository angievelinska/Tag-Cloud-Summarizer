Please do not use special characters in resource names. They can cause trouble in publication (esp. /, \, :, *, ?, !,", <, >). 

The server checks for the following resource names:

Which start or end with a space,
which only consist of one or two dots,
which are empty,
which contain the slash "/".

You can't create resources with such names.
