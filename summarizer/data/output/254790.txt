The usage is:

cm sql [-script <scriptname>]

If a SQL script is passed via the option -script, the script will be executed.

After entering cm sql, a connection to the CoreMedia system database is opened using the database settings configured in sql.properties (see section 5.1.1.3).

If the command is carried out in a Windows environment, a graphical user interface opens which allows SQL commands to be entered.
