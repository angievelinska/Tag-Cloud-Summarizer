The dimension tables shown in the previous diagram were already discussed in conjunction with the fact tables. In the following, only the actual permanent report tables are discussed, which are marked using the «permanent» stereotype.

You can see that all report tables contain an XX placeholder in their name. There is one of these tables for each time interval type as described in Section . In the actual table name the XX is replaced by the interval type code.
