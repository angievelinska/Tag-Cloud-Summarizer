Folders can contain both subfolders and documents, but only documents are displayed in the document overview. 

To find out whether there are subfolders, see the marks in front of the folder icons in the folder overview  window:

( + )  The folder contains subfolders. Click on the cross in order to open.
( - ) The view of the folder is fully expanded, all subfolders are shown.
(   ) The folder contains no subfolders. 

Only one folder can be opened at one time. The open folder is marked by the open folder symbol.

You can also select multiple consecutive or non-consecutive folders from the folder hierarchy or documents from the document overview.
