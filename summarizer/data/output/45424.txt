The headline of the website is the Image inserted in the Page Document. It is displayed on top of the website as a table row. In the next row, the login jsp is included using <%String loginUri=""+resource.getUri("login");%> and <a href="<%=loginUri%>">login</a>. The navigation bar and the "window" where the dishes are displayed are two cells in another HTML-table. The navigation bar consists of links to the "dish folders".


The "dish window" on the right hand side displays the resource on which the main() template is called. This is done by executing the command


 <%context.include(pageContext,resource,"render"); %>. 


If Resource.main() is called on the main folder MenuSite, the template Page.render() is called. If it is called on a subfolder like "Poultry" Folder.render() is called.


Look at the site by selecting the folder MenuSite in the editor and clicking preview.
