XML Export

When exporting the report to XML, an XML document is generated with an 'entries' element enclosing a 'metainformation' element holding report title, report sentence and generation time as attributes as well as one 'entry' element per data entry, holding 

the x (category) value in attribute 'X_VALUE', 
the displayable name of the x value in attribute 'X_VALUEDISPLAYNAME'
the y value in attribute 'Y_VALUE'
plus additional attributes that are report-specific.

Please note that time attributes are rendered in the following format: <UTC time in millseconds> + '[' <time in local date and time format> + ']'
