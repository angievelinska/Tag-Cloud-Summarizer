A report definition specifies the following administrative properties and models (follow the 'Performance' report definition in the framework configuration file analytics-reportdefinitions.xml in cap-analytics-config.jar as an example):

a report definition bean id (Spring bean definition id), defined in the enclosing bean tag - the id used in dashboard view definitions to refer to a report definition. By convention the bean definition id has the name structure 'ReportDefinition.name'
a report name - a name which identifies a report definition in dashboard views
required roles - roles of which the user is required to assume one in order to view the report
a view definition - parameters controlling the report rendering.
a report state model - the high-level report model defining variables, data model and queries.

After having copied and renamed an existing report definition, you should first adjust the report definition's id and name. Next, you should define the report definition's state model and its mapping to a technical data model (explained in the next section). After that, you will define the report view rendering: you will localize variable values, the report sentence and explanation. Finally you will define the report's required roles and deploy the newly created report definition to the dashboard.
