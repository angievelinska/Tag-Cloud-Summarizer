Starting with CoreMedia SCI 4.2, the server verifies that resource names do not contain the slash character (/). Such names are error-prone, because they make paths difficult to parse. The names of existing resources are kept stable, but you are strongly encouraged to rename existing resources, if they happen to include a slash in their name. 

In particular, you must rename all offending resources before you attach a Slave Live Server. Otherwise, when the Slave Live Server creates resources, it checks for correct resource names, possibly resulting in a failed replication.

In order to find all resources that violate the naming restriction, you can issue the following SQL query on both the Content Server and the Master Live Server. 

SELECT id_, name_ FROM resources WHERE name_ LIKE '%/%'

If any rows are returned from this query, you have to rename the affected resources on the Content Server appropriately.
