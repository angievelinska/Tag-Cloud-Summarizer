CoreMedia CMS is a content management system for easy and convenient creation and administration of up-to-date content, interactive features and personalized web pages. 

For this purpose, CoreMedia provides an environment for online editorial workflow processes. Users can simultaneously create and edit content and so conveniently maintain a website. Integration of contents from print editorial systems, office applications and news agencies (dpa, SID, Reuters, etc.) is possible via import mechanisms. Internet display of the content or creation of various export formats is made possible by the CoreMedia Active Delivery Server (ADS) with its flexible template technology or by the CoreMedia Content Application Engine (CAE).

Key distinguishers for CoreMedia CMS are transparent editing processes, graded user and rights administration and easy integration into an existing system landscape.
