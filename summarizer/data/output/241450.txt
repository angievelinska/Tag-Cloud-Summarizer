A ClientResource (com.coremedia.cap.wage.ClientResource) is a resource (hox.corem.servlets.Resource) that can be modified locally on the client. All changes are visible for the client immediately, but for other clients only after the current set of changes (which is held by a ChangeCollector, see below) has been submitted.

As in the Active Delivery Server API, there are two types of ClientResources: A ClientDocument (com.coremedia.cap.wage.ClientDocument) is a specialized Document (hox.corem.servlets.Document) that additionally provides setter methods and contains all changes made locally to any of the implied or schema properties of the Document.

A ClientFolder (com.coremedia.cap.wage.ClientFolder) extends hox.corem.servlets.Folder and represents the client's view of a CoreMedia Generator Folder.

Local changes to impled properties represent actions to be performed when the changes are commited. For example, setting the name_ property of a resource will rename it, or setting the folderId_ will move it.

ClientResources can also represent new resources, which don't exist on the server yet. Such resources are called client-only resources and are created on the server when the current set of changes is submitted successfully. ClientResources can be created by calling one of the createResource() methods of a ClientFolder.

Nevertheless, ClientResources can contain links to other resources, both to resources already existing on the server, and to client-only ClientResources.

ClientDocuments implement the DynaBean interface (org.apache.commons.beanutils.DynaBean), so that the Jakarta BeanUtils allow to access CoreMedia documents as if they were dynamic JavaBeans (see the discussion at the beginning of this section).

The connections between these interfaces are shown in the following UML diagram:
