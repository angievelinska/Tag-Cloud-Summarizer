Actions are used to automate or semi-automate tasks. Two kinds of actions exist:

Actions running only on server side.
3* Server-side actions run completely inside the CoreMedia Workflow Server. They may use the CoreMedia Workflow Server's session to the CoreMedia Content Management Server to access resources.
Client actions running partly on the server and on a client.
3* ClientActions in a user task run remotely using the Client GUI's session to the CoreMedia Content Management Server to access resources. ClientActions in an automated task run in a server internal client environment using the CoreMedia Workflow Server's session to the CoreMedia Content Management Server to access resources.
