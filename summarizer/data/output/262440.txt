The Starter Kit supports multiple websites or short sites. Note that Starter Kit sites are not the same as the ¿sites¿ in CoreMedia multi-site publishing (see the Administration Manual for details). Multi-site publishing allows different sites using the same content management server to be published to different Master Live Servers, but does not allow content sharing between sites. Starter Kit sites may be placed in the same or in different multi-site publishing sites. For any two Starter Kit sites, you can decide whether it is more important that the Master Live Servers are separated (and thus content has to be separated), or that content can be shared between sites (which means you have to publish to the same live server). "For any two sites" means that this is not a global decision, but you can group all Starter Kit sites that share content and still publish these groups to different live servers. Hier wäre eine Grafik nett.
