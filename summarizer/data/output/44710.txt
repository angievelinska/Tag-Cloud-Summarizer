It may be the case that files are present in the inbox directories which should not be imported as source documents. A typical example for this are graphics which are referenced without path by a blob property in a CoreMedia XML document. On the one hand, such graphics must lie in the same directories, so that the importer finds them, but on the other hand should not be imported as independent source documents. For such cases, a further property can be entered in addition to inbox and sleepingSeconds: filenameFilterClass. The value of this property must be the name of a Java class which implements the java.io.FilenameFilter interface. If this property is specified, a file is only imported if its name is accepted by a FilenameFilter of this class. If your files have meaningful names, it is usually possible to decide according to the filename extension whether it is a source document or another file.
