ForkSubprocess

Grammar: ( (Variable | AggregationVariable)*, Parameters) 

The ForkSubprocess task starts a separate workflow process, which is referenced by its name, from the current process. 

If detached is set to true the forked subprocess has no relationship to its parent process. If set to false, which is the default, a suspend, abort or resume on the parent process suspends, aborts or resumes the forked subprocess, too. 

The forked subprocess may be parametrized via Parameter child elements.
