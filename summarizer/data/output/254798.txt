If the content is not marked for deletion or withdrawal, also approve the latest version. -av Approve all versions following an already approved version of any content below the base folder. Also approve the places of contents containing such versions. -b Publish all resources below the base folder that are approved but not published yet and that are not marked for deletion or withdrawal. -c Check-in all documents below the base folder which are checked-out. -f The path of a folder for which you want to start the operations (e.g. /articles/sport).
