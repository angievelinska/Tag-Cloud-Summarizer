Simple CoreMedia document properties like Strings can be edited directly with appropriate HTML input elements or property editors provided by the Struts Web application framework.

However, more complex CoreMedia document properties like XML or LinkList properties also require powerful property editors. The user has to be able to use the full functionality of each property type, and should directly see the changes he made, like for example when editing RichText.

CoreMedia WAGE provides you with appropriate property editors for all available property types. You can use them directly in your Web application, or further customize them for your specific needs.

There is an "edit" view available for all property types, which will instantiate the appropriate (JavaScript) property editor when included. You then have to provide a mechanism for calling commands on that editor, like strong() for the XHtmlEditor, which will mark the currently selected text in the editor as bold, or addResource(id) for a LinkList editor, which will add a CoreMedia resource to a LinkList. Providing the user with a way to select these commands can for example be done by defining and including an appropriate WAGE toolbar (with the <wage:toolbar> tag). See XXX for an example.

The following property editors are important building blocks of CoreMedia WAGE:

BlobEditor: Supports uploading a file as CoreMedia blob property, or removing a stored blob.
DateEditor: Edit CoreMedia Date properties with this editor.
LinkListEditor: Used to edit CoreMedia LinkList properties. LinkLists can be reordered, entries can be deleted and new entries can be added with this property editor. See XXX for an example.
XHtmlEditor: Allows the user to edit RichText directly in a web browser, including text formatting (italic, bold, etc.), inserting images into the text, editing lists and tables, and linking to other CoreMedia documents or external resources. See XXX for an example.

For a detailed reference on these (and other) components, please refer to the WAGE JavaScript API Documentation.
