Updating non-web applications

To update the spring configuration files of non-web applications (such as the Proactive Engine and the CAE Feeder) according to the new modular configuration, apply the following tasks:

Move the files from the framework directory to an config.jar file and place them below /framework/spring in this jar-file.
Move the spring configuration files from properties/corem/<componentName> into the config/<componentName>/spring directory.
Replace the example files with your custom configuration files.
