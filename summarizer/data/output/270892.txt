Deployment Overview

When you deploy a portlet application two steps are performed by the deployment tool:


The portlet application is adapted to the portal: 

some additional entries which are specific to the portal are added to the web.xml inside the war file
some extra files like TLDs, which are also portal-specific, are added to the war file.


The portlets contained in the war-file are registered in the content repository. 

for each portlet a CMPortletDef (see CMPortletDef) and a CMPortletInst (see CMPortletInst) is created and filled with the values provided by the portlet.

How to Use the Deployment Tool

The following shows the usage of the command line tool for deploying a portlet application.
In this description the command line calls are shown relative to <your-starterkit-installation>/management/bin.
Prepare portlet: 

cm deployportlets prepare -i <path to warfile> -o <output path>
2# 
Register portlet in content repository: 

cm deployportlets register -i <path to prepared warfile>
-u <repository username> [-p <password>]  
[-path <path in content repository>]

You can execute both steps with one single call for simplicity:

cm deployportlets [all] -i <path to warfile> -o <output path>
-u <repository username> [-p <password>]  
[-path <path in content repository>]
