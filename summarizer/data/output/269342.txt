Build the server
Generate the portable artifacts for the server: Run

$ ant generate-server

You will see some "Annotation types without processors" warnings which you can ignore (see http://java.sun.com/webservices/reference/tutorials/wsit/doc/Examples_glassfish5.html).
The generate-server target creates a build directory and generates three portable artifact classes for the path and the ID.  As a developer you don't need to care about the artifacts.  They are used only by the JAX-WS runtime, the application does not access them directly.  They consist of fields, getters and setters for the data as well as JAXB annotations which tell the JAX-WS runtime how to map the data to XML snippets.

Your WebService is now ready to be compiled and deployed.  Call

$ ant compile-server war-server deploy-server


Alternatively you can run

$ ant server


which subsumes the four targets.

If Tomcat is not running yet, start it now, and make sure that it is listening on the host and port you configured in the global.properties file (localhost:8001 is used throughout these examples).  Your WebService named jaxws-cms-01-cms should be running now. Check this with the Tomcat Manager application. You can request the WSDL description of the WebService now by opening http://localhost:8001/jaxws-cms-01-cms/cms?wsdl with a browser.
