A page is characterized by three properties: an object as discussed in the previous section, a view and a locale.

Views

Views of the Analytics Engine correspond directly to the views defined in the Content Application Engine. For example, there might be different views for rendering the same object as HTML, as WML, as PDF and as an email message. 

Views are characterized by string identifiers. Typically, the number of views is small. While there are often many views in a content application, only very few of those views are used to render pages on the top level. However, only those views are relevant for the purposes of the Analytics Engine.

The default view, which is represented as a Java null value internally in the CAE, is stored as the string DEFAULT in the database. This is because some databases exhibit a very special behavior when working with empty strings, which would otherwise be a more natural representation.

You should never use the view represented by the empty string when integrating with the Analytics Engine.

Locales

A locale identifies the language in which a page is displayed and optionally the region for which the page is localized. While the locale can be derived from the object and the view in many cases, some applications may want to show the same object in the same view differently for different locales.

Locales are characterized by two-letter language codes like de or ja or by five-letter codes like en_US that include the country. Typically, the number of locales is small.
