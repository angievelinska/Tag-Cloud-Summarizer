The CoreMedia API allows the construction of declarative queries to the repository (see Section 4.2.5). It is not possible to reconstruct the dependencies of a query result. This means that no pages containing query results can be stored in the cache or updated correctly.

Similar to the method described in Section 4.5.3 you can execute the query in a template marked as non-cacheable and compose the result page from fragments from the cache.
