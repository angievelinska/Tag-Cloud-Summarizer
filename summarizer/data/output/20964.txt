Script-based installation allows automatic execution of the CoreMedia SCI installer. By using a text script file CoreMedia components and their basic configuration can be installed without further user input or graphical display.

This way the installation of different CoreMedia components could be done e.g. on distributed Unix computers from a central computer via telnet or SSH connection.

To execute a script-based installation, use the "p" function (play script) of the installer.

The script-based installation can be executed using the command:

java -jar cap-<rel.no.>.jar -p [install.script]

If no file name is entered for the script file, the file install.script is used as default. Different configurations can easily be archived with the help of different script file names. If the installation is to be carried out on an external computer, the files cap-<rel.no.>.jar and install.script must be copied to this computer in a directory with read/write rights and then the command given above has to be executed.
