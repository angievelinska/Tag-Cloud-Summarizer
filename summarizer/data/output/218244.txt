Some restrictions exist when using Java 5.

Generally mixed usage of older Java versions and Java 5 is not supported for CMS Components. 

Some of the recommended third party components only support Java 5 under certain circumstances. Hence the following restrictions exists:

Oracle database is only supported for CoreMedia components, if the Oracle JDBC Driver Version 10.2.0 is used.
Microsoft SQL Server database is only supported for CoreMedia components, if the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver is used.
