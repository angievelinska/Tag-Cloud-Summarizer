For localization of texts and names shown in the CoreMedia Editor defined in the CoreMedia Server, a file following the naming scheme name[_<locale>].properties can be used. It can be located in either class path or jar file.

Example for the naming:

German: com/customer/cap/editor.properties

English: com/customer/cap/editor_en.properties

French: com/customer/cap/editor_fr.properties



The Bundle name com.customer.cap.editor is configured with the Bundle element of the editor-startup.xml. 

Within the files, name/value pairs define the localized names. For each object a name and a tooltip text can be configured. The naming scheme is as follows:

<Name of the object defined in the CoreMedia Server>[/<Name of the property>]Label or  

<Name of the object>[/<Name of the property>]ToolTip. 

The value is the localized name.

If you want to change the embedded labels of the CoreMedia Editor (e.g. a menu item or the label of a button) you need to know the keys of these labels. You will find the keys in the file hox/corem/editor/toolkit/property/property_de.properties which is located in the cap-editor-resources.jar file of an editor installation.

Example:

To localize some German names for use in English language, create a file $COREM_HOME/classes/com/customer/cap/editor_en.properties. In order to rename a document type called Bild to Image, define:

BildLabel=Image

To rename the property Piktogramm to Thumbnail and to add a tooltip saying "Preview Image" define:

Bild/PiktogrammLabel=Thumbnail

Bild/PiktogrammToolTip=Preview Image

It can be seen that properties are designated via the preceding document type name and are separated by a slash. Therefore, the names of document types must not contain slashes for proper localization of properties. This file can be stored in a jar file to make distribution easier.
