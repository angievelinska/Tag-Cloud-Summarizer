The difference between the generic get()/set() and the getProperty()/setProperty() methods is that the generic get() and set() methods are using the PropertyChangeCollector (see XXX). There, new property values are stored preliminary as simple objects, usually Strings. When set() is used, the property change will only be visible in the ChangeCollector if the commitToChangeCollector() method of the PropertyChangeCollector has been called and was successful. "Successful" means that the simple objects could be converted to the appropriate data type of the property (see conversion). To conclude, get()/set() are usually used when values are output to or submitted by the user, while getProperty()/setProperty() should be used in server-side actions, when typed values are to be read or manipulated.
