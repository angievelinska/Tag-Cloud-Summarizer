The query skeleton comprises a bean type expression and one or more property value comparison expressions. 

The bean type expression allows narrowing the result set to beans of either one exact bean type or beans of a bean type hierarchy (subtypes included).

Property value comparison expressions can be based on bean properties or repository-implied properties. The latter are not bean properties, but provided by the respective bean repository. Typically, ID and name are repository-implied properties. The Configuration section will explain how to define repository-implied properties.

Per default, all query (sub-)expressions, identified in the Bean Query Editor by names `#1¿ through `#n¿, are conjunctive terms (connected by `AND¿ operator). Change the skeleton field to introduce `OR¿ and `NOT¿ operators, optionally with parentheses.

Please note that before the Bean Query Editor can be used, the bean type model, including bean types, bean properties and storage-implied properties must be setup and configured. See the Configuration section for this.
