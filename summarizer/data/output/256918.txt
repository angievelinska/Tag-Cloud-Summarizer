CoreMedia applications handle two kinds of objects: documents and folders. Documents consist of structured content which can be edited in the editor. Folders structure and organize the content. Documents and folders are subsumed under resources. They share the following characteristics:



they are located in a folder


they have a name


they have a unique ID number.

Documents have a definite type. The available document types are defined once by the project team of the CoreMedia system. The type of a document is defined at creation, it cannot be altered afterwards. The document type specifies the number and types of fields in a document (see section).

Resources are initially created on the Content Server. They must undergo approval and publication before they appear on the Live Server. Changes to a published resource, too, must be published before they appear on the Live Server.

Resources are in different states during the editorial lifecycle. Read more about the states of documents in section, and more about folder states in section.
