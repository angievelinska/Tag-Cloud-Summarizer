Mostly, you have to add another parameter after cm <component name>:



install: Registers the component as Windows service (only on Windows platforms). See section for details. 


start: Starts the process in the background on UNIX platforms or as Windows service on Windows platforms. Requires install in the latter case.
run: Starts the process in the foreground. On a Windows platform the process is not started as a Windows service and needs no install first.
term <signal>: Stops the process by sending the given signal (only on UNIX platforms).
stop: On a UNIX platform, stops the service by sending the TERM signal, waiting for 10 seconds and then sending the KILL (9) signal if the process is still running. On a Windows platform stops the Windows service, previously started with start.
kill: Stops the service by sending the KILL signal immediately (only on UNIX platforms).
restart: Restarts the service. Same as stop followed by start.
status: Checks whether a service is active or not.


threaddump: Writes a threaddump to a file.


uninstall: Unregisters the component as Windows service (only on Windows platforms).

The cm command always changes the working directory to COREM_HOME. Thus, if a relative path is given as a parameter (e.g. with the -script parameter in cm sql) it must be relative to COREM_HOME.
