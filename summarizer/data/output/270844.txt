The CoreMedia Lightweight Portal comes with an example portlet window layout. It provides means for rendering the portlet window frame including control buttons for changing the window state and portlet mode.

Installing the window controls consists of two steps: 
Importing the CSS layout 
Adding the style sheet to your portlet window 

A jsp template for the view type that makes use of the CSS styles is already included.

Importing the CSS layout to the content repository

Before you install the layout make sure that you have the CSS-Importer installed in your starter kit.
To import the CLiP example layout to your content repository perform the following command.

<your-starterkit-installation>/management/bin/cm
css-portallayout-import run

The layout will be installed in the content repository under the path /System/Portlets/CLiP_example_layout

Adding the style sheet to your portlet window

In your portlet window set the field Associated CSS to /System/Portlets/CLiP_example_layout/css/CLiPexample.css

If you preview the page with your portlet window on it, it should look like this:
