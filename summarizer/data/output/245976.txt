Figure 1 shows an architecture diagram of Editing Services. You can see that Editing Services uses Beans and APIs of the CAE (for example DataViews, IdSchemes, and LinkFormatter), the Unified API (essentially Content services and objects) and of the underlying J2EE application server. Editing Services runs as a Web application within an application server, dedicated to serve a Web-UI. Note that the CoreMedia CMS Content Server is yet another backend server (not shown in the figure). The clients, be it a browser or a Java application (the ULC runtime deployed by Java WebStart), talk to the Editing-Server via HTTP. The JSF-specific part of ES is contained in a so-called Editing Kit, i.e. an adapter for a concrete Web UI framework, in this case for JSF. The ULC Editing Kit is dotted since it is currently only a proof-of-concept prototype.
