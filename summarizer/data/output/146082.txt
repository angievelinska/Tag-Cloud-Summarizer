Members of administrator groups are supposed to do administrative work in the CoreMedia system. Therefore these members have special privileges:

See all workflows
See all rules attached to a resource and differentiate between Live Server groups and Content Server groups.
Check-in and check-out resources of all users
Direct approval and publication
Create new users and groups
Create wide links in a multi-site environment

Right after installation there exists only one administrator group with one user; the group administrator with the user admin. It is not possible to revoke the administrator flag from this group in order to prevent the admin user from lock-out. From all other administrator groups you are able to revoke this flag.
