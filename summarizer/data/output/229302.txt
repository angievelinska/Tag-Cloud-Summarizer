The point in time parameter allows you to compare the most recent repository structure snapshot with former repository snapshots. In the default configuration, a repository structure snapshot is taken once per day, with the most recent snapshot being taken the current day at midnight. Per default the most recent snapshot is selected, but you may choose to select the following snapshots:

From yesterday - The predecessor of the most recent snapshot.
One week ago - The snapshot preceding the most recent by 7 days.
One month ago - The snapshot taken one month before the most recent. A month ago usually refers to the same day of month, if possible, thus June 15 is 'a month before' July 15. If no such day exists, the date is adapted. The date in the selection box will clarify what date is used.
A quarter ago - The snapshot taken three months before the most recent one.
Half a year ago - The snapshot taken six months before the most recent one.
A year ago - The snapshot taken twelve months before the most recent one.

Points in time for which no data is available are shown in red.
