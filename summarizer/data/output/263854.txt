workflow.server.managers.aggregator.index.rebuild.threshold int 30000 The minimum number of rows in staging tables such that indices are kept during the log import; below this number, indices are disabled and completely rebuilt after the import; if 0, indicates that indices should never be disabled and rebuilt; if -1, indicates that indices should always be disabled and rebuilt; currently only supported on Oracle workflow.server.managers.aggregator.logprovider.<n>.url URL  This property can be given as often as desired for different values of n; each row indicates the base URL for managing and retrieving URLs from a Content Application Engine with enabled tracking; typically, these URLs are of the form http://<host>:<port>/<webapp>/servlet/analyticslog workflow.server.managers.aggregator.unique.users.enable
 boolean true Whether the aggregation of unique user statistics is enabled workflow.server.managers.aggregator.unique.users.approximate boolean  true Whether an efficient, but approximating method should be used for counting unique users workflow.server.managers.aggregator.archive.purge.delay time specification 0 The time for which processed data is kept archive tables; if 0, indicates that archive tables are never purged workflow.server.managers.aggregator.archive.purge.duration time specification 10m The time for which data from archive tables is purged in a single transaction workflow.server.managers.aggregator.archive.purge.interval time specification 1w The approximate time between two purges of an archive table workflow.server.managers.aggregator.insite.purge.delay time specification 0 The time for which processed data is kept in In-Site Analytics tables; if 0, indicates that archive tables are never purged workflow.server.managers.aggregator.insite.purge.duration time specification 10m The time for which data from In-Site Analytics tables is purged in a single transaction workflow.server.managers.aggregator.insite.purge.interval time specification 1w The approximate time between two purges of an In-Site Analytics table workflow.server.managers.aggregator.snapshot.purge.delay time specification 0 The time for which processed data is kept in snapshot tables; if 0, indicates that archive tables are never purged workflow.server.managers.aggregator.snapshot.purge.duration time specification 23h The time for which data from snapshot tables is purged in a single transaction workflow.server.managers.aggregator.snapshot.purge.interval time specification 1w The approximate time between two purges of a snapshot table workflow.server.managers.aggregator.dashboard.<xx>.purge.delay time specification 0 For any time interval type <xx> (one of hh, dh, dd, wd, bd, md, dd, ww, mm, ym, qq, ff, yy), the time for which processed data for the given time interval type is kept in Analytics Dashboard tables; if 0, indicates that such tables are never purged workflow.server.managers.aggregator.dashboard.<table>.purge.delay time specification the value configured for the time interval type of the table For any specific Analytics Dashboard table <table>, the time for which processed data is kept in that table; if 0, indicates that the table is never purged workflow.server.managers.aggregator.dashboard.purge.duration time specification 1d The time for which data from Analytics Dashboard tables is purged in a single transaction workflow.server.managers.aggregator.dashboard.purge.interval time specification 1w The approximate time between two purges of an Analytics Dashboard table
