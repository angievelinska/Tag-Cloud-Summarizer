In general, the Content Server creates default database tables in default table spaces but it's also possible to define custom table spaces for specific content categories. 

Configuring a table space for BLOB data

The binary content of BLOBs stored in the CoreMedia CMS has different access characteristics than other content properties: it usually read from beginning to end in a streaming manner, and BLOBs are generally too large to be cached in database main memory. Therefore, you may want to store BLOB data in a different table space than other tables automatically created by CoreMedia CMS.

The required settings depend on the type of database in use and are described in this chapter for all supported databases. The settings described are only basic configuration steps. When tuning is required, a database administrator has to be involved.

Generally, the Content Server creates the table holding BLOB data when you start it first. You can augment the DDL create statement used by the Content Server's sql-scripts with own extensions. Use the property db.blob.tableoptions in the database specific property file (e.g. properties/corem/db2.properties).

By default, this property is commented out, causing the database to select a default table space. The commented line shows the syntax of the relevant SQL fragment for the respective database.
