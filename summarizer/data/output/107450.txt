If it is not possible to supply the importer with source documents according to the principle described in the previous section, you can implement your own mechanism on the basis of the Importer API. Understanding this section requires knowledge of Java; in particular, the Importer API is based on JAXP. 


You can find the Importer API in the CoreMedia installation in importer/index.html, when you unpack the file cm-<Rel.No.>api.zip.


Unless the package is explicitly given, the classes and interfaces mentioned in this section come from the javax.xml hierarchy or from com.coremedia.publisher.importer. There are no name conflicts between these packages.


The importer internally functions not with files but with document sets. Such a document set contains the source documents to be imported in one operation. A source document can be represented in various ways, indirectly via a URL or directly as a series of bytes or as a DOM tree. 


The combination of these document sets is controlled by a class which implements the MultiResultGeneratorFactory interface. The name of this class is entered in the configuration file:
