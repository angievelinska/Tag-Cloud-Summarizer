You start the server for the first time or after changes of the document type definition and an ArrayOutOfBoundsException occurs.

Possible cause:

The problem occurs when the number of document types is a multiple of 64 due to an error of the IBM XML parser used.

Possible solution:

Add an abstract dummy document type to the document type definition.

The server starts up and the virtual machine crashes several times.

Possible cause:

This problem occurs when using certain combinations of kernel/glibc under Linux with Sun Hotspot 1.2 to 1.3.

Possible solution:

The problems might be fixed by reducing the default stack size. Depending on the shell, the server is started from, add one of the following possibilities to an appropriate file, e.g. .profile. At bash shell, do ulimit -s 2048; at tcsh use limit stacksize 2048. If there are still problems, GLIBC 2.2 / Linux 2.4 users should also define an environment variable: 

export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5

A publication is possible, but reports that no action was necessary to publish the document. The document, or the most recent version, does not appear on the Master Live Server.

Possible cause:
The properties - in particular the URL of the live server in publisher.properties - are incorrectly configured.

Possible solution:
Check the properties. It might point to the Content Server.
Restart the live server. The use of separate computers for the Production and Master Live Servers is recommended.

The server shows poor performance when accessing the database; in particular, it seems to be almost at a standstill every 24 hours.

Cause:

The database systems supported by CoreMedia SCI do not update their statistics data for tables and indexes automatically (except the MS SQL-Server). This leads to the situation that database queries are not optimised and are therefore only processed inefficiently. Once every 24 hours, the CM Server places a query to release unreferenced objects. If the statistics data and indexes are not optimised, this query cannot be processed optimally.

Solution:

Using database maintenance, update the statistics data daily for all tables and indexes of the corresponding CoreMedia database user on the production and live systems.

With an Oracle database the following SQL command must be executed, e.g. with sqlplus or another suitable program for each CoreMedia database user for the purpose of optimisation:

call dbms_utility.analyze_schema('<Database user>', 'COMPUTE')

When using a DB2 database, optimisation can be done with the corresponding menu entry in the DB2 Control Center.

The commands given should be executed either under the corresponding CoreMedia database accounts or an administration account with the appropriate privileges.

Note: The standard interval of 24 hours can be modified, if necessary, with the parameter sql.store.collector.delay=<sec>, in order to set a larger or smaller timespan for memory checking. However, this should usually not be necessary.

The server no longer works correctly with an Oracle database and reports the following SQL Exception:

ORA-01000 maximum open cursors exceeded

Cause:

The configuration of the database is incorrect.

Solution:

The database administrator must adjust the Oracle configuration (see section 5.1.1.3.1) and restart the database.

You are using Sun Solaris and while starting the server the error message "couldn't set locale correctly" appears.

Possible cause:

The package SUNWceuos is not installed on the machine.

Possible solution:

Install the package.
