As a very simple application, here is a little tool that aborts all running workflows.

  WorklistService worklist = 
    connection.getWorkflowRepository().getWorklistService();
  Set<Process> running = worklist.getAllProcessesRunning();
  for (Process process: running) {
    process.abort();
  }

The code deals with the workflow repository and one of its aspects, the worklist service. The worklist service maintains a number of collections of workflow objects. Each collection contains those workflow objects that match a certain predicate: running processes, escalated tasks, available process definitions, and so on.

In the example AbortAllProcesses, we use one of the administrative worklists. The method getAllProcessesRunning() returns the set of all processes that are started, but not yet finished.
