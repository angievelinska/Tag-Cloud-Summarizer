In order to activate the ContextMenuRenderer, or the ToolbarRenderer (in this section now called render) please change the file WEB-INF/spring/editing-jsf/dispatcher-servlet/pbe.properties of your web application. Add the following property for the ContextMenuRenderer:

pbe.renderName=pbeInlineContextMenuRenderer

And for the ToolbarRenderer:

pbe.renderName=pbeToolbarRenderer

Usually these properties are already available in the property file, you only need to uncomment the entries. 

Setting the URI pointing to the ActionExecutionController

If you are using one of the above mentioned renderer, you need to configure at least one property: the commandUriPrefix. It contains the URI which points to the ActionExecutionController. To change that URI customize the property: pbe.renderer.commandUriPrefix in the file pbe.properties. The URI is relative to the context path. The following line configures this property:

pbe.renderer.commandUriPrefix=/servlet/command/

For a detailed list of properties which may be altered, please have a look at the framework beans: pbeAbstractToolbarRenderer, and pbeInlineContextMenuRenderer and the corresponding JavaDoc of the bean classes.

Configuring of the ActionExecutionController

The bean configuration for the ActionExecutionController is located at: framework/spring/editing-jsf/dispatcher-servlet/editing-jsf-controllers.xml. The bean property: executableActions is a List of Action bean names which are allowed to be executed by that controller. 

The ActionExecutionController is mapped under in the dispatcher servlet under: /command/* as defined by the bean definition named: actionExecutionControllerMapping in framework/spring/editing-jsf/dispatcher-servlet/editing-jsf-controllers.xml.

Keep the configured actionExecutionControllerMapping ("/command/") in sync with the property commandUriPrefix of the Renderer.
