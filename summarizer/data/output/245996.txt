The first backing Bean for the table is an Editing Services component of type com.coremedia.editing.BeanTable.  The contained table model is based on the specified LinkList property, and the BeanTable has a column model using the standard columns for Content objects, defaultContentColumnModel, defined in the abstract Bean abstractContentTable (for details about these Beans, see Bean documentation).

The second backing Bean defines a JSF-specific controller for this BeanTable, simply by using the class com.coremedia.editing.kits.jsf.BeanTableController and referring to the first backing Bean, the LinkList's BeanTable.

The Bean definitions can be placed in an arbitrary Spring XML file in /WEB-INF/spring/editing-jsf/dispatcher-servlet. The recommended name for the file containing all custom view backing Beans is editing-jsf-views.xml. The meta template that has to be instantiated for every link list property is shown in link. property and docType  are meta variables defined as before.
