JSF is a standard, component-based Web GUI framework and part of J2EE 1.4.

Out of the box, JSF uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) for its display technology, but JSF can also accommodate other display technologies, such as XUL. 

JSF includes:

A set of APIs for representing GUI components and managing their state, handling events and input validation, defining page navigation, and supporting internationalization and accessibility.
A default set of GUI components.
Two JavaServer Pages (JSP) custom tag libraries for expressing a JavaServer Faces interface within a JSP page, where one tag library is general and one is HTML-specific.
A server-side event model.
State management.
Managed Beans (JavaBeans created with dependency injection).

The JSF specification was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 127, which defined JSF 1.0 and 1.1, and JSR 252 which defined JSF 1.2. ES uses JSF 1.1.

JSF allows its components to access arbitrary Java Beans via JSF Expression Language (JSF-EL), which is similar (but not equal) to the expression language known from the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL). The main addition of JSF-EL over JSTL-EL is that not only getter methods can be invoked through EL, but also setter and event handler methods. This corresponds to what ES adds to the CAE: writing access to Beans and user interaction through widgets.
