Each document is uniquely determined by the value of its id attribute. It can be referenced to via this ID by other documents. In the example below, you can see that the document called MyDocument contains a link <link idref="pic1"/> to the second document.

The importer supports two types of ID: 



target IDs


3* Target IDs refer to documents which already exist in the CoreMedia SCI repository. They begin with the prefix target: followed by the actual document ID which is always a positive even number.


internal IDs


3* They are only valid within the consistency check of an import procedure and are later mapped to target IDs by the importer. They begin with the prefix internal: followed by the actual document ID which can be a string, containing any character allowed for NMTOKEN. The internal document ID must be unique in the set of documents to import. 

If the prefix is missing, the type of the ID is determined in the following way:


The system checks whether the ID occurs in the import set or not. If a document can be found, the ID is treated as internal. This was the behaviour in previous releases of CoreMedia SCI.


The system checks for the ID in the CoreMedia repository. If  a document can be found, the ID is treated as target.


If no document with this ID was found at all, the import will fail. 

The documents for import must form a closed set with regard to their referential integrity, i.e. no documents can be imported which refer to unknown IDs. For internal IDs, this means that the referenced document must also be contained in the import group. A document which is referenced with a target ID must already exist in the CoreMedia SCI repository.

The following example is intended to illustrate this - for clarity reasons we limit ourselves to the elements and attributes relevant in this context.
