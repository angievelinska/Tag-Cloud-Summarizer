CoreMedia SCI allows to access the MS Word spellchecker (if installed) and also to create and maintain user-defined dictionaries. The following Microsoft Word versions can be used:

Word 2003
Word 2007

The use of the spellchecker feature parallels the use of the MS Word spellchecker. Erroneous or unknown words are underlined in red and can be corrected via context menu. The language settings of the CoreMedia Editor determine the language of the spellchecker dictionary.

The use of the spellchecker must be activated by the administrator of the CoreMedia system.

Cross-Language Installations

If OS and Microsoft Office have been installed in different language versions this might cause errors when using the spell checker with the CM Editor.

Example: Your computer runs on a German Windows, your Office application is an English one - as are your CoreMedia Editor and the language of your CoreMedia project. 

Solution: It is not sufficient just to change the Language Settings within your Office application. 

You have to go to Programs | Microsoft Office Tools | Microsoft Office Language Settings. Set the default language to English and remove German from the list of enabled languages. 

This  does not change the installed Office components themselves.

Explanation: The default language had been set to German - no matter if dictionary or grammar available - automatically due to the user profile of the German operating system. This problem can be abstracted for any cross-language installation, so proceed in analogy for other languages. It is a genuine Microsoft problem.
