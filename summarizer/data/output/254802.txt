You can use the republish tool to publish all content and versions below a given folder which have been published in a given period. A major use case is the update of a Master Live Server which has been recovered with a backup (see section).

There are certain limitations when using this tool:

Because the tool spawns only a single publication, it should not be used when there are many thousands of resources to be published. In particular, for the recreation of a fresh Master Live Server from a Content Management Server the tool cm publishall described in section is more appropriate.
The tool cannot repeat the publication of withdrawals and deletions.
The tool cannot repeat the publication of resources that have been marked for withdrawal or deletion after being published.
The tool cannot repeat the publication of moves and renames of resources that have been moved or renamed again after being published.
If the publication of a new folder fails for any reason, no resources contained in the folder can be published.
If the publication of a new document fails or any reason, no documents linking to that document can be published.
