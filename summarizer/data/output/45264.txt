Now the first dish can be added to the menu. Lets add a fish dish. 
Click the right mouse button in the folder view on the new directory Fish and select new|Dish. As can be seen, all other document types created in the last chapter can be selected here. 
The new Dish needs an identifier to be distinguishable from other dishes in the database. Name it SpicyTrout and click [okay]. A new document window for the Dish opens up.
