 Property Value Default Description import.loginAttempts  int -1 This property defines the number of failed login attempts after which the importer aborts. If import.loginAttempts=-1 the importer tries to login without abortion. import.enforceCompleteVersion  boolean true 

This property handles the processing of XML importer-files. See the Importer Developer Manual for details on the CoreMedia XML format.

import.enforceCompleteVersion=true
For each <version>-element in the importer-file a new version will be created in the CoreMedia repository. For all properties of a version the values must be given. It is not allowed to omit a property.
import.enforceCompleteVersion=false
Now it is possible to omit even all property elements of a version. If there are only action elements (see the Importer Developer Manual) and the document already exists on the server, then no new version is created and the corresponding actions are applied to the document (delete) or to the latest document version on the server (approve, delete). If there is at least one <property>-element in the <version>-element then for every property that is specified in the document type but missing in the XML importer-file, the property value of the predecessor document version ist taken. If there is no predecessor version, then a default value is inserted, that depends on the property type. The default property values are those that hox.corem.scripting.Folder:createDocument() creates for a specified document type. import.validate-textproperty  boolean false If "true" the importer validates all XML text properties against the associated DTD. If a validation fails, no document is created on the server. For big XML properties the validation may take a while.
