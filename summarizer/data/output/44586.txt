XML is a generic format. However, the importer cannot guess the meaning of various tags, but requires a certain format - the CoreMedia XML format.

To achieve a visual separation between XML elements and attributes, the elements are written in the following in pointed brackets: <element>. The attributes are written in italics: attribute.

Files here are XML files or XML documents  while document means documents in the sense of CoreMedia SCI.
