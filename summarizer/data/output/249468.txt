If you intend to integrate third-party tools into the analysis itself, there are basically two scenarios:

The external tools are used to generate additional data, for example when importing data from an ERP system.
The external tools are used to analyze the existing data or to export the data to other systems.

For both tasks you will likely want to extend the aggregation process that runs in the Analytics Data Integrator. As described in section, that process provides several extension sections where you can place the code for invoking external tools. Doing so ensures that the third party tools run at defined times, avoiding unexpected concurrency. If you can control concurrency in another way, you can of course access the Analytics Database directly at any time.

Another topic would be the integration of third-party systems as sources for rendered data. The Content Application Engine can also render objects that do not originate from a CoreMedia Content Server. The Analytics Engine is capable to log and analyze access to such objects, too. As for the CAE, only a means for representing external entities as ids is required. But when statistics are displayed, a display name is required. This name can be obtained by an extended Object Analyzer that accesses the third-party system.

Lastly, third-party systems may be used for managing visitors or for tracking sessions. In this case, the plug-in interfaces described in section are good starting points for an integration.
