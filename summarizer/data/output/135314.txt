Styles

To make the hover effect of the contextinfo tag visible you have to provide a css style "hover". As soon as the mouse moves over the element, the style changes to "hover". When the user opens the context menu, the style of the contextinfo area changes from "hover" to "pressed". To handle the different situations in style sheets, the two possible ways of applying the contextinfo tag must be distinguished: either nesting the editable element or connecting editable element and contextinfo tag with ids. The following example shows a suitable style set for the span element generated in the first case.

Example 4:

<head>
  <style type="text/css">
    span.hover {
      background-color: highlight;
      color: highlighttext;
    }
    span.pressed {
      background-color: highlight;
      color: highlighttext;
    }
  </style>
</head>

If you choose the second alternative and provide an id, you have to set the style class for the HTML element with the id instead of the span element.

Be aware that stylesheets for big websites may become very complex. You may have to provide more specific css rules to get the correct hover effect.

You may also adapt the style for the pop-up window, which is named "popupwindow". The context menu is rendered in com.coremedia.easyedit.cae/MenuBean.jsp.
