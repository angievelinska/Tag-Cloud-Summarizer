If you want to query and modify master and variant versions, you can use the interface com.coremedia.starterkit.common.localization, LocalizedContentService and its default implementation DefaultLocalizedContentService (in the same package).
In contrast to the Content Bean API, this interface is based directly on Unified API objects such as Content, Version, and their super type ContentObject, since  content  beans are not suited to handle document versions. The advantage is that you can retrieve the exact version of a master or a variant, and that there are convenience methods to query whether a variant is up-to-date and to create and update a localized variant. The service hides the integer masterVersion property and the calls to IdHelper (see the isUpToDate() example in section).
Since many methods come in two flavors, content and version, Java 5 Generics have been used to keep the interface concise. For example, the method signature

  <CO extends ContentObject> CO getMaster(CO variant);

means, ¿The master of a Content is a Content, and the master of a Version is a Version¿.
For further details on method semantics, see the JavaDoc of LocalizedContentService and the Starter Kit API JavaDoc.
