Error behavior
 

The clients hang up or receive error messages until the watchdog restarts the server.
 

Error correction
 

The watchdog detects the error and restarts the server. Restarting the server implies a brief server failure. Therefore, the further behavior of the clients corresponds to the behavior described under Live Server Failure.
