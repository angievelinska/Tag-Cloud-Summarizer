The FileUploader writes files for every value it receives to the local file system. With page generation one file is created for every generated page with the file path equal to the resource URI of that page. 

If a FileUploader receives a value which was generated by a custom builder, it will write its serialized form to the file system. The file path is equal to the scheme-specific part of the value's key.
