Expressions come in two variants: 

generic expressions and

boolean expressions.

A generic expression must evaluate to a java.lang.Comparable result and can be used for example in a <Less> or <Greater> expression. A boolean expression must evaluate to a boolean result value and can be used for example in an <Condition> task.

Expressions can be used for many purposes in the workflow:

Guards for automated and user tasks
Pre- and postconditions (assertions) in automated and user task


Validators for variable assignments in client views
Conditions for branching tasks
Guards for actions
