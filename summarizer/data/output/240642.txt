Content Rules are defined on the content management side. CoreMedia provides an editor extension, the Bean Query Editor (BQE), which supports editors in the definition of rules. Additionally, the execution of rules may be previewed. 

The Bean Query Editor (BQE) allows creating and manipulating rule definitions. Structurally, the BQE¿s user interface is divided into two parts: The upper part defines the query skeleton, while the lower part holds result sorting and result set limit options. The status line displays the query string that corresponds to the query structure. 

The following screenshot shows the Bean Query Editor (BQE). Its interface corresponds structurally with the Advanced Query Editor (AQE) that can be used to specify queries against the content repository.
