The Database Message Service is installed together with the ProActive Delivery Server (as an optional subcomponent).  The graphical and the script based installers will install the Database Message Service and configure its properties. The configuration information can be found in the following files:



properties\corem\pads.xml

This file contains the configuration of the ProActive Delivery Server and its uploaders. In order to use the Database Message Service the DBMessageUploader needs to be configured correctly as described in section.


properties\corem\dbMessageServiceConfig.xml

This file contains a spring configuration for the servlet which forms the interface for any client that wants to use the Database Message Service. The only configuration element that may be changed is the bean definition for the defaultDataSource.


\properties\corem\dbmessageservicecleanup.xml

This file contains a spring configuration for a cleanup-utility for the messages stored in the Database Message Service.

It is important that the configuration of the database to be used is consistent in all of the three configuration files!
