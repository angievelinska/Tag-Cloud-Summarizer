The different properties of the Dish document type have to be handled in different ways:

XmlProperty 
3* The description of the dish is stored in a XmlProperty and has to be unparsed. At first, context.include(...) is called what is a convenience method for <jsp:include page="<%= context.getIncludeUri(uri) %>" flush="true" />. The unparsing is done by the template PropTypes/SgmlText/default.jsp which uses the domUnparser-class.
StringProperty 
3* This property can be easily accessed via document.getStringProperty("ingredients"). I.e. the content of the StringProperty ingredients is directly inserted in the HTML-Page. 
LinkListProperty 
3* The Picture for the Dish is included via the LinkListProperty pictures. At first, the content of Pictures is got via getLinkListProperty("pictures") then this Picture document is included with the template Picture/render.jsp that was created (and renamed) in the last chapter. (For a full description of the code refer to a JSP manual, the Developer manual for CoreMedia SCI and especially the API-javadoc.)

Now you can look at the render view of a Dish "RolledPorc" in the folder Meat by setting the browser to:

http://localhost:8001/coremedia/generator/MenuSite/Meat/RolledPorc, templateId=render.html

Your browser should display something like this:
