The Global-search-and-replace workflow is intended to change text in many documents. E.g. a company name has changed or a name was misspelled. It is not recommended to use it as a pure search tool. The workflow uses the direct search in a document in order to perform the changes interactively or automatic.

In Section you will find how to use the Global-search-and-replace workflow.
