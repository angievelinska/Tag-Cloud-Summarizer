The PublicationService allows you to control the publication process and to inspect the state of the publication queue.

When a content is created, it exists on the Content Management Server only. The process of transferring the content to the Master Live Server is referred to as publishing the content. Before a content can be published, it has to be approved. In general, the approval of a content refers to its location in the folder tree. It is approved that the content appear on the Master Live Server at a given place, hence the name place approval for this type of approval which can be performed by the method approvePlace(Content). When a document is published, a version must be created on the Master Live Server, too. To this end, the version itself must be approved using the method approve(Version). Only an approved version can be published. Even if a content is published, subsequent movements, renames, and property changes happen on the Content Management Server only. New places or new versions must be published explicitly.

When a content is supposed to leave the Master Live Server, it must be marked for withdrawal or deletion using the methods toBeWithdrawn(Content) and toBeDeleted(Content). After that operation is place approved, the content can be included in a publication set. During the subsequent publication, the content is removed from the Master Live Server instead of being updated. In the case of a mark for deletion, it is also moved into the archive on the Content Management Server.
