Configure Service Names

The CoreMedia SCI Installer already configures the attributes necessary to install a CoreMedia component. The attributes are defined in the bin/<component>.jpif file. The attributes are:



SERVICE_NAME: 


The service name must be unique across all Windows services on the host, as it is an identifier for the service.


SERVICE_DISPLAY_NAME: 


The service display name is displayed in the name column of the service list window you can open with ControlPanel|Administrative Tools|Component Services|Services (Local). The display name must be unique across all service display names on the host.  


SERVICE_DESCRIPTION: 


The description is displayed in the description column of the service list window (available only in Windows 2000 and above)


SERVICE_DEPENDENCIES: 


A list of service names (service identifiers) the current service depends on. E.g. a CoreMedia Importer service depends on a CoreMedia Content Server service. Only services on the same host can be listed here.

You only have to change the values of SERVICE_NAME and SERVICE_DISPLAY_NAME attributes if you configure more than one component of a type on a single host (e.g. more than one Content Server or more than one XML-Importer). The CoreMedia SCI Installer will always set the service name and service display name of a component to the same value. The three different SCI server types (Content, Master Live Server, Slave Live) have their own service names and service display names.
