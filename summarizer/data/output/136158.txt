This class is also provided in the cap-examples.jar as distributed with the release. Simply copy the file

capclient/src/com/coremedia/examples/capclient/HelloWorld.java

to the file 

classes/com/coremedia/examples/capclient/HelloWorld.java

in your installation directory. Compile the class using 

javac -classpath \
 lib/cap-unified-api.jar:lib/coremedia-common.jar \
 classes/com/coremedia/examples/capclient/HelloWorld.java

where cap-unified-api.jar contains the Unified API interfaces and coremedia-common.jar contains some reusable utility classes.

To run the example class, invoke Java as follows:

java -classpath lib/cap-client.jar:classes \
 com.coremedia.examples.capclient.HelloWorld

You may notice that cap-unified-api.jar and coremedia-common.jar have been replaced by cap-client.jar on the command line. The file cap-client.jar contains the implementation classes for the Unified API. Actually, there are even more jars needed when running the example, but all of these jars are included implicitly through the class path specified in the manifest file of cap-client.jar, so that you do not have to list them individually. 

Having run the example class, a folder named hello world should have appeared in the content repository. You may want to open the CoreMedia Editor for verifying the success of this operation.
