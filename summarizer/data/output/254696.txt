There are two possibilities to recover a corrupted Master Live Server database.

Recovery with Master Live Server's backup
Stop the Master Live Server. The Slave Live Servers will still be running. However, no publications will be possible.
Restore the backup of the Master Live Server.
Restart the Master Live Server; since the Slave Live Servers do have a newer content base than the Master Live Server, no replication is possible and the Slave Live Servers have to be recovered as well .
Recover the Slave Live Servers as described in Section.

Because a backup for the Master Live Server has been restored, all publications executed in the time between creating and restoring the backup are not available on the Live-side. You can use the tool republish (see Section) to repeat the publications automatically.
