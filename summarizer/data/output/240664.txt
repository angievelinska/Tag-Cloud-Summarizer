It is advised to store rules (more precisely: their query string representation) in a custom content type¿s String property. The advantages are:

content rules can be versioned;
content rules are propagated to the delivery CAEs using normal publication workflows;
seamless Bean Query Editor integration: The Bean Query Editor can be registered as a custom property editor (see the Configuration section). Editing the string property will launch the Bean Query Editor.

We therefore recommend that you create a custom content type for content rules, with properties for the rule query string and optionally meta data (rule description, rule validity time frame, etc.). No type is provided out-of-the-box.
