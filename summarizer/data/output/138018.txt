A Content Server can store an arbitrary number of persistent key/value pairs in a dedicated database table. These values can be used to store global resource-independent states. For example, some values are used internally to store the current database schema version and other information.

The PropertyService allows you to access this persistent store. The PropertyService presents the table as a map from strings to strings. You can get individual entries or the entire map and you can set and remove key/value pairs.

It is advisable to keep the number of key/value pairs moderate. It would be possible to store the path of a configuration folder or perhaps the time of the last run of a certain script. It is not recommended to store individual values per document and folder. 

Please refer to the documentation of PropertyService for information about reserved keys that may not be used for arbitrary purposes.
