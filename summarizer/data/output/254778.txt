The verbose output of the publications tool looks like this (sample, one publication only):

pending publications:
  publication: coremedia:///cap/publication/3
    priority: 60
    user: rolf (coremedia:///cap/user/102)
    preview: false
    size: 4
    stage: 4

You can also run publications without the -v option and obtain the details of a publication with the dump tool (see section x.1.1).
