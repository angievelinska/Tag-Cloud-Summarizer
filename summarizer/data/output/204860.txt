Due to a bug in Microsoft SQL Server, it is not possible to perform certain necessary schema updates automatically when migrating between CoreMedia CAP 4.1 or earlier and CoreMedia SCI 4.2 or later.

After a CoreMedia Content Server has been started with CoreMedia SCI 4.2 or a later version for the first time, it must be stopped again immediately. Afterwards, issue the following SQL command:

alter table Resources drop column isMarkedForUnpublication_

Finally, the server can be restarted.
