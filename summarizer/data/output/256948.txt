CoreMedia SCI is shipped with a WebDAV Server and so supports WebDAV-enabled application such as Microsoft Word 2000: You'll have direct access to documents in the CoreMedia repository, displayed as WebFolder for this purpose. Of course, you'll have to have READ rights on the resources in order to view them.



For more information about the rights system go to section.


For a sample WebDAV routine, go to section.
