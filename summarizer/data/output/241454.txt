As said in chapter-introduction, WAGE takes care of converting property values from the internal data type to a simplified external representation and vice versa. This external representation is usually a String, but also allows boolean values and JavaBeans. The JavaBeans should again only contain String or boolean properties or other JavaBeans satisfying this constraint.

While the methods implementing the DynaBean interface (get()/set()) return and set a property in the external representation, the methods implementing the Document interface (getProperty()/setProperty() and the typed variants getXxxProperty()) and the methods getInternal()/setInternal() in the VariableAssignment interface return and set properties in the internal representation.

In document-property-mapping, the default mapping from internal to external representations for property values of Documents is shown.
