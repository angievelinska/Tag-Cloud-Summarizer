The importer allows to define XSLT style sheets which transforms XML files of your format into the CoreMedia format. This stylesheet is automatically executed on import.


The XSLT interpreter used in CoreMedia requires stylesheets corresponding to the W3C Recommendation of the 16.11.1999. This particularly concerns the XSL namespace in the <xsl:stylesheet> element, which must be set to


xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"


Older XSL editors still generate the variant from an earlier Working Draft:


xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform/1.0"


This is out-of-date and not supported by CoreMedia.


The value of the class property in the configuration file for an XSLT transformer is XsltTransformerFactory. Furthermore, the desired stylesheet must be defined with property.stylesheet.
