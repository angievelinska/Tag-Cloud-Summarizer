The Default "Anonymous" Subject

Before a client chooses to log in, it has no subject at all. Since every rule in SCI is bound to a group, such a client has no rights at all. Therefore, in order to show content, you can specify a set of groups that a non logged-in user will assume.

For example:

generator.setAnonymousUserGroups(new String[] { "public@company.com"})

instructs the Active Delivery Server to treat an anonymous user like a user that is in the group "public" in domain "company.com".
