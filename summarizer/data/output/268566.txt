For optimal operation, the following settings should be made in the browser:

Set the memory cache to a generous value (e.g.: 3000 kB). In this way, the content of forms is not forgotten after error messages.
The option "Compare document in cache with that in network" (Netscape) or "Search for newer version" (Internet Explorer) must be set to "at each request". Otherwise, out-of-date information may be obtained.
