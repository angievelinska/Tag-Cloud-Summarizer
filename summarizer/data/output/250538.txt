Using this element, a column in the document table view is defined. 

  Attribute  Description  name  Name of the column which is shown in the header of the column.  class  This attribute is used for selecting a class for displaying the column (e.g. IntColumn, StringColumn see Section 5.8.1.1.2 for details). This determines the field type which can be displayed. Furthermore, the class sorts the contents of the column.   width  This attribute is used for defining the minimum width of the column in pixels. If the window width is smaller than the total sum of all column widths, a scroll bar appears. Scaling for a larger window is controlled with the attributes weight and resizable. The default value is 100 pixels.  weight  This attribute gives the relative weight of a column in the scaling. Rational numbers are entered. The default value for all columns is "1.0".  resizable  This attribute is used for defining whether a column is resized at all. The default setting is "true", i.e. the column is enlarged. Resizing can be switched off with "false".  searchField This attribute can only be used for column definitions in the <Search> element. Set it to the name of the Search Engine's index field that should be used for sorting. The field must be sortable in the Search Engine, and the Search Engine Feeder must set its value accordingly. You can either use predefined index fields or define custom ones in the index profile of the Search Engine. For the latter case, see the Administration and Operation Manual how to set custom fields with the Search Engine Feeder.
