Read the FAST Operations Guide on how to start the search engine in a UNIX or Windows OS. If you have configured the search engine with the default ports and invoked the search engine start command, open a web browser with the URL http://<search-engine-host>/admin:16000 to access the search engine administration pages. For FAST ESP these pages are password-protected (default login is user admin with empty password). Select Logs from the main menu to see the log entries and possible startup problems. Select Search View to test if search is available. At the first start this can take from 3 to 15 minutes and maybe more depending on the performance of the host machine. If searching on the Search View is possible and no errors were logged, you can start the CoreMedia CMS Content Server or CAE Feeder and start feeding content. 

If this does not work, look for error messages in the log. Select System Overview and System Management from the main menu in the administration panel to see the status of each search engine module and server process. Each module, except DataSource, must be in state Responding and each search engine server process must be in state Running. If you can¿t access the administration panel, open the file all.log and look for error messages. The file is contained in the directory <search-engine-dir>/var/log for FAST InStream 4.3 or <search-engine-dir>/var/log/syslog for FAST ESP.
