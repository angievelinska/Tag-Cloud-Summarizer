The Document Model Browser can be found in the "CoreMedia Template Development" area, located in a standard CoreMedia installation under the URL http://<generatorHost:generatorPort/coremedia/develop. There, "Browse Document Model" should be selected. 

The Document Model Browser has various functions which can be executed via hyperlinks in the upper region, as well as the actual diagram, which also contains various hyperlinks.

The diagram can be expanded in stages in order to display a certain section of the document model. A white box is displayed for each document type, containing the type name and the type symbol (if it exists). The type symbols must be saved under the path <COREM_HOME>/tomcat4/webapps/coremedia/images/doctype-icons according to the scheme <doctypename>.gif. Abstract document types are written in italic.

Each document type box can be expanded or collapsed. The state is changed by clicking on the type name or symbol with the mouse.

Collapsed types are shown in gray. Expanded types, on the other hand, are shown in black, with their properties, views (if ViewDispatcher is being used, see the Delivery Developer Manual ) and subtypes. According to UML notation, subtypes are connected with their supertypes by an arrow.

The properties are displayed in the format name: Type, corresponding to the document type definitions as shown in following table.
