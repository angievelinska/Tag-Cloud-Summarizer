General usage

All server utilities are implemented as cm programs as described in section 5.1.4, i.e. you run them from the command line with cm or cmw. Most of the tools open a session and therefore need a user who is specified by three command line options -u, -d and -p.

Furthermore you can explicitly specify the IOR URL of the content server to connect to. If you don't specify the URL, it is taken from capclient.properties.
