The Http Cache is an extension of the CAE web application which is used for caching http responses. 
This chapter describes Http Cache related administration issues only, without explaining the underlying concepts. Have a look at the Content Applications Developer Manual for further details.

Http Cache Webapp Configuration

The Http Cache plugin for the CAE web application template (contentapplicationengine-template) consists of a few more files:

An additional directory WEB-INF/spring/httpcache/ containing custom configuration files is introduced. 
An additional jar-file cap-httpcache-config.jar containing framework configuration files is introduced. The framework content are not intended to be changed by customers.
The file WEB-INF/web.xml has been extended

All configuration issues for the standard template (such as configuration of the objectserver.properties or log4j.properties) also apply to the Http Cache template. In addition, the file WEB-INF/spring/httpcache/httpcache.properties needs to be adapted.

Database

You have to specify a database for the Http Cache. Before configuring the database properties, you have to create a new database user as described above. Alternatively, due to the use of different tables you can reuse the same database user which you are using for the CMS repository.
