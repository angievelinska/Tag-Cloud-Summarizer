The configurations delivered with CoreMedia frameworks can be divided into two groups.

Framework

Framework configurations define essential components and configurations of the framework. Therefore, they provide a kind of basic infrastructure, which should not be changed quickly in projects, in order to preserve the correct operation of the whole application. On the other hand, CoreMedia might change these files in the course of maintenance. 

Custom

Custom configurations contains the files, which define the concrete appearance  of the application in a project. Some custom configuration files are shipped with the CoreMedia CMS but you can and should replace, remove or modify these files in the course of a project. Each file contains a description, which shows how to adapt the file in a sensible way.

Custom files can be divided in two sub groups.

Examples

These are configurations which are intended as examples. That is, the files show how you can do the configuration of a specific aspect of the application. These files contain "example" in the name (cae-linkschemes-example.xml for example) and you will typically replace them in a project.

Default settings

These are configurations of some aspects, which are intended as sensible default settings. In most of the projects, you can use these settings with no changes at all or at most small changes or extensions.
