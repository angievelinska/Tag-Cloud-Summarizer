ADS cache consistency requires the timely processing of repository events, since these events carry information about changes to the content repository. Interruption of event processing over a longer period of time will thus lead to outdated cache contents. Under normal circumstances the event queue should always be empty or emptied quickly. 

The event queue may become blocked as follows: an event for a content object that has just been read by a cacheable template can only proceed after that template has completed execution. The event and all following have to wait. If that template does not terminate or runs for a considerable amount of time, the event queue will stall. In such a case, the entry ¿invalidationStack¿ in the ADS status page can help identify the offending template. It displays the stack of recursive invalidations up the stalled one.
