Start the DBMessageServiceReceiver from the command line: 

bin/cm dbmsgreceiver start [options] 

or start the DBMessageServiceReceiver as a foreground process: 

bin/cm dbmsgreceiver run [options] 

The following options are supported: 

-p <property.bundle>: 
3* Use a different configuration bundle for the DBMessageServiceReceiver. Default is 
corem/dbmessagereceiver (which corresponds to 
properties/corem/dbmessagereceiver.properties). 
-d: 
3* Do not buffer events. Without this option the uploader gets events not until a commit message marking a consistent state was received. 
-r: 
3* Subscribe a receiver with the Database Message Service. 
-i <file>: 


3* Initialize the attached uploader with all values contained in the given file before receiving starts.
