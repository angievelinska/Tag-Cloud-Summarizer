Example

If you use the following call from the lib directory of your content application web application,

java -jar beangenerator.jar 
-d /contentserver/config/contentserver/doctypes/menu-doctypes.xml
-o /output/classes
-d /properties/package.properties
-beanmapping /properties/contentbeans.xml
-e Picture
-generic

with the following package.properties file,

doctype.Dish.package=com.menusite.dish
package=com.menusite

this will generate interfaces, base classes and implementation classes for all document types of the menusite example except for the Picture document type. The document types are read from the /contentserver/config/contentserver/doctypes/menu-doctypes.xml file and the generated classes are written to the /output/classes directory. 

The Dish document type belongs to the com.menusite.dish package while the other types are in the com.menusite package, this information is taken from the /properties/package.properties file. The bean mapping is written to the /properties/contentbeans.xml file. Generics are used which results in code like the following:

public List<? extends Dish> getContent() {
    List/*<Content>*/ contents = getContent().getLinks("content");
    return (List<? extends Dish>) createBeansFor(contents);
  }
