Rules are executed in the context of CAE-based web applications on the content delivery side. Their execution is determined by the containing CAE application. Typically it is triggered by a request to render a rule-based webpage. 

It is the CAE application¿s responsibility to select a rule and execute it. Upon execution, a rule¿s query expression is evaluated using a Query Service, yielding an ordered set of CAE Content Beans, which is then processed and rendered using known CAE mechanisms.

Rule Execution Environment

Rules run against a Content Bean repository, which holds a persistent representation of Content Beans and provides a Query interface for retrieval. A bean repository can be understood as the rules¿ `working memory¿.

The default Content Rules Execution Environment is as follows:

Bean Repository: a Fast Search Engine collection is used as bean repository;
Bean Repository feed: the CAE Feeder is used to asynchronously pump content object state information into the bean repository;
Bean Query execution: the CoreMedia Fast Query Service is used to evaluate rule queries against the repository.

A Fast search engine collection is not per se a Content Bean repository, hence the mapping of bean types and properties to their representation in the collection must be addressed. The Content Rules framework defines a mapping configuration of bean types and properties to storage. It will be explained in the Configuration section.
