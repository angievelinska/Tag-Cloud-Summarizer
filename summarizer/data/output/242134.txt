The WorkflowRepository in com.coremedia.cap.workflow handles processes and tasks. It provides two aspects WorklistService and AccessControl.

You may want to start with the interface Task and inspect its methods and its state diagram. The access to variables of a task is exactly the same as the access to properties of a content (see CapObject). Keep in mind, however, that there are additional data types available in the workflow context.

Afterwards, consult the interface Process, memorize that although there are some similarities in its state diagram, equal state names mean different things for processes and tasks. See ###states for further details.

Conclude the first look at the workflow repository with the WorklistService aspect and examine the various collections of workflow objects it provides. Some background information is provided in ###worklist.
