  Value Default Description sql.store.convert.<DocumentType>.<PropertyType>=<com.customer.XMLConverter>   Converters which are used to convert custom XML formats which have been defined for the obsolete coremedia-sgmltext.dtd. sql.store.convert.correctRichText=true true/false true The editor in versions before SCI 4.1.38 created XML text, which was not valid according to the coremedia-richtext-1.0.dtd. If you have created content with versions before SCI 4.1.38 set the property to "true" to correct these errors (we recommend to use always "true"). sql.store.replaceSubstitute=false true/false false There are problems with zOS DB2 databases to store characters that are not in the databases character set. Such characters are converted to the character with the code "0x001A" upon read. If the property is set to "true", this character will be replaced with the character defined in sql.store.substituteCharacter, thereby avoiding the replacement character that is illegal in XML texts. sql.store.substituteCharacter=<character> Char '?' The character, with which "0x001A" should be replaced.
