This element is used to configure whether the CoreMedia can be remote controlled or not and to set the port where to listen for requests.

The remote control of the CoreMedia Editor allows to execute 

all commands which may be executed on resources in the explorer view,
all commands which may be executed on process and task instances in the workflow view and
custom commands, which may be executed on resources, process and task instances, or external parameters given to the command.

Technically, the remote control is realized via HTTP by an embedded webserver inside the Editor, which listens to remote control requests. Note that if you start two editors on the same computer which use the same configuration, remote control is disabled for the second editor, since it tries to use the same port. You could use custom configuration files for different users, specifying different ports, though.
