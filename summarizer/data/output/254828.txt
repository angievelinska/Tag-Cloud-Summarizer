  Attributes  Optional  Description  id  No  Each uploader must be configured with a unique and persistent identifier. The identifier is used to detect new uploaders and to send them all values that were generated before the uploader was registered. You can disable this behavior using the attribute receiveInit.   filter  Yes  Using the filter attribute you can define a regular expression that restricts the pages that should be sent by this uploader. Only pages whose resource URI matches the filter expression are passed to the uploader. The default is ".*", i.e. all pages are sent to the queue or topic.  receiveInit  Yes  

Set this attribute to "false"  if the uploader was added to the configuration after the first start of PADS  and should not receive notifications about existing values.



If set to "true"  (default), the uploader will receive update events for all values that were generated and not yet removed by PADS before the uploader was configured. The uploader receives these events once when PADS starts and if it detects the uploader as new, i.e. if the uploader was not configured at the time of the last start of PADS.



Note that uploaders always receive notifications for updates and deletes which happen after they were added to the configuration.



This attribute has no effect if the uploader is added to the configuration before the first start of PADS or if it is configured in a JmsReceiver or DBMessageReceiver.



Initialization of JmsUploaders with lots of existing entries should be avoided. A JmsReceiver can be initialized with the values of existing entries as described in section.   builder  Yes  If you have developed custom extensions to generate other values than pages, you need to set this attribute to the scheme of the custom builder (which is mostly the builder's class name). The attribute also accepts a comma-separated list of several builder schemes. Read the CoreMedia Developer Manual for more information about builders and schemes.  initialContextFactory  No  Name of the initial context factory class of the JMS provider.  providerUrl  No  The URL to access the JMS provider.  connectionFactory  No  Name of the connection factory class of the JMS provider.  topic  No  The name of the topic to which the JmsUploader should connect. Cannot be combined with attribute queue.  queue  No  The name of the queue to which the JmsUploader should connect. Cannot be combined with attribute topic.
