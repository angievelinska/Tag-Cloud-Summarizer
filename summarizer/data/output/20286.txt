After import, documents remain checked out by the import user, or their content is empty.

Possible causes:

The import does not operate strictly transactionally. If an error occurs between the actions Create document, Edit document, Check in document, the repository remains in an intermediate state.

Possible solutions:

The actual cause of the problem is indicated in the log file, var/logs/<my>-xmlimport.log. Import the documents again after solving the problem. After a completely successful import the repository again has the expected state.
