 Attribute Description class This attribute is used to enter the editor class to use. Default is hox.corem.editor.generic.GenericEditor. loginName This attribute is used to enter the default name for login. If no name is entered, the name from the environment is used. You can always change the name during login, it is just a preset. If a login name should be predefined, it must be set in the editor-startup.xml file. If a global editor.xml file is used for all users it might be sensible to set the login name in the editor.properties file. loginPassword This attribute is used to enter the default password for login. If no password is entered, the login name is used. You can always change the password during login, it is just a preset. If a login password should be predefined, it must be set in the editor-startup.xml file. If a global editor.xml file is used for all users it might be sensible to set the login password in the editor.properties file. loginDomain This attribute is used to enter the default domain for login. You can always change the domain during login, it is just a preset. If a login domain should be predefined, it must be set in the editor-startup.xml file. loginImmediate If this attribute is set to "true", an attempt is made to connect directly to the server with the login data given above. The login window does not appear. The default value is "false". showCurrentUser If this attribute is set to "true", the name of the current user of the editor is shown at the top of the window. Default is "false", i.e. the user name is not shown. startup This attribute defines the CoreMedia Editor window to start with. Possible values are "OpenExplorer" "OpenQuery", "OpenWorkflow", "OpenUserManager" which will open the respective window. As default, the CoreMedia Editor starts with the Explorer window ("normal" user) or with the user manager window ("administrator" user). startupMode 

This attribute defines the start-up mode for administrators. If set to "4.2" the super user with ID "0" always starts with the User Manager window. All other users will start with the window defined using "startup".

If set to "5.0" the super user with ID "0" and all members of the administration group start with the User Manager window. All other users will start with the window defined using "startup". Default setting is "5.0". enableExplorer This attribute is used to disable the Explorer window of the CoreMedia Editor (false). Default is "true", i.e. the Explorer window can be opened. enableDirectPublication This attribute is used to enable direct publication ("true"). Default is "false", i.e. no direct publication icons and menu items are shown. enableWorkflow This attribute is used to disable all workflow related menu items and icons ("false"). Default is "true", i.e. workflow features are enabled.  removeEmptyParagraphs 

The CoreMedia Editor adds empty paragraphs around tables in order to enable the user to enter content before or after the table (this circumvents a Swing problem). By default ("false"), these empty paragraphs are saved on the server. If you set this attribute to "true", empty paragraphs without attributes will be removed in the following cases when writing rich text back to the server:

At the beginning of rich text, if a table follows: <div><p/><table>
At the end of rich text following a table:</table><p/></div>
At the beginning of a table cell, if a table follows:<td><p/><table>


At the end of a table cell following a table: </table><p/></td>



Warning: If enabled, the representation of rich text on the server will be changed, if a document is saved in the CoreMedia Editor. mayChooseMemberFromOtherDomain If set to "false" (default) only members of the administrator group are allowed to search for users in other domains using the User Manager window. Non-administrators can only search in their own domain. If set to "true", every user may choose a domain for search.
