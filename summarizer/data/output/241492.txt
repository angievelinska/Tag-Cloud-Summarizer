The WAGE tag library encapsulates some of the features WAGE offers and therefore facilitates the development of WAGE JSP templates. Amongst others, the following WAGE tags are available:

<wage:toolbar> and <wage:cmdButton>: for rendering a toolbar with command buttons for calling a command on a JavaScript component.
<wage:menuBar>, <wage:menu>, and <wage:menuItem>: for rendering application-like drop-down menus.
<wage:documentState>: renders an icon for the current state of a CoreMedia resource, like checked in or checked out

For a complete reference of the available WAGE tags and their attributes, please refer to XXX.

One of the more sophisticated tags of the WAGE tag library and how you can extend and adapt it to project-specific needs is explained here: The <wage:cmdButton> tag renders a HTML image tag with an onclick-handler that will try to execute the command set with the command attribute on the currently focused property editor. Note that the <wage:menuItem> tag functions quite similar.

If you are using a predefined command (for example from com.coremedia.cap.gui.resources.RichTextCommandNames), an appropriate image and tooltip etc. is rendered automatically. Otherwise you may also set the image's source with the src attribute. The <wage:cmdButton> can only be used within a <wage:toolBar>.

You have to assure that only commands are available that the currently focused editor can understand. Otherwise you will possibly get a JavaScript error. One way to do this is to use a FocusListener (see XXX) to hide and display command buttons according to the currently focused editor.

It is also possible to define own commands, e.g for combining two simple commands like bold and italic for the RichText Editor. You first have to define some properties like tooltip and icon for your new command in a *.properties file:
