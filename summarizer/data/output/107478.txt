In order to keep the stylesheet simple we assume that some elements are generally available although they are optional according to the DTD. Our stylesheet should execute the following obvious mappings:


The heading results from the contents of /nitf/body/body.head/hedline/hl1.

The contents of nitf/body/body.content should be adopted as text

For importing a document, we need a name and an ID. Since the document contains no element with suitable content for this, we simply take the file name.


The content should not simply be adopted as pure text but be sensibly matched to the structures of our coremedia-richtext-1.0.dtd DTD:


The <p> paragraphs of the xmlnews document are adopted 1:1 as <p> in coremedia-richtext-1.0.dtd.


While paragraphs and headings are general standard building bricks of any document, the xmlnews Inline Markup within <p>, e.g. <location>, is application-specific. Therefore there are no adequate coremedia-richtext-1.0.dtd elements for this. Nevertheless, we want to save the information:


The xmlnews Inline Markup is matched to <SPAN> elements whose CLASS attribute is set to the name of the original element (e.g. location).


This should be enough for an example of the functionality. The remaining components of our Text document will be filled with default values. 


Before we deal with the actual transformation, we define a utility function and a variable in which we first save the filename:
