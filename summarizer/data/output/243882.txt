Validator


Grammar: (Expression) 


A validator verifies variable bindings to keep certain rules, which are defined in the Validator element.


By default, the variable bindings are verified only on initial process assignment or task completion. If validatedOnSave is set to "true", the verification takes place on every save.


To specify a valid state, you provide an expression to the validator.
