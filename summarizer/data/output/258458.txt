Proceed as follows to configure the ConditionalMediaStoreSelector:
Take the blobstore-example.xml file as a template for your media store selector.
Add a new <bean class="hox.corem.server.media.ConditionalMediaStoreSelctor"> tag below the <list> tag of the <customize:prepend bean="blobstore" property="mediaStoreSelectors"> tag or uncomment an existing configuration from the file.
Add a <property name="storeName" value="selectedMediaStore>"/> below the <bean> tag and replace "selectedMediaStore" with the name of the media store where the blob should be stored.
Construct your matching condition.

Configuring store locations for file storage

You can change the default locations for the storage of BLOBs in the file system.
Open the file blobstore.properties in the config/contentserver/spring/blobstore directory.
Uncomment the appropriate property and add your path:

For the location of BLOBs stored in the file system use the cap.server.blobstore.file.rootdir property.
For the location of BLOBS zipped and stored in the file system use the cap.server.blobstore.zipfile.rootdir property.
For the location of temporary files for BLOBs zipped and stored in the database use the cap.server.blobstore.zipdbblob.tmpdir property.
