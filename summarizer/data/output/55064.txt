Using the functions in the upper area, navigation can be simplified and clarity increased. The functions in detail are:



admin home // develop home - switches to the "CoreMedia Generator Administration" or "CoreMedia Template Development" homepages.


expand all - all document types are expanded.


hide/show properties - display of properties is suppressed globally (hide) or allowed again (show).

If the ViewDispatcher is being used, views of documents are displayed in the UML notation for operations. Then there are two further functions:



hide/show views - as for properties, display of views can be suppressed globally.


update views - the View templates are read anew from the file system. This function is also available in the "CoreMedia Template Development" region.

If views are displayed, they are hyperlinked to the template source text. A click on a view opens the source text in a new window. The template can also be disabled there.
