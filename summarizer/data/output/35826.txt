The first task in the workflow is an automated task that assigns a user to the main task - the user task 'Compose' - of the workflow. The user to assign is the creator and thus owner of the workflow.



Line 1 - 2 + 4:  The automated task is named 'AssignComposer'. The names of tasks are used in the definition of a successor of a task. The task, that is started after task 'AssignComposer' completes, is 'Compose'.


Line 3: The Action element defines the action which should be executed in the automated task. Here the predefined ForceUser action is used, which assigns the user defined in userVariable to the task defined in task. Thus, the Compose task will only be offered and automatically accepted to the user defined in the variable OWNER_. WfVariableOWNER_ is a predefined variable which contains the user, who created the workflow.
