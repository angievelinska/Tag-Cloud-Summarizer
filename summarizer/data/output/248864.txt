Note that




it is possible for some pages to be generated that aren't reachable through a hyperlink, if you call Uri#toString without using the result as a hyperlink;



links are not followed when you compose them by hand, instead of using Uri#toString.


In order to configure ADS for offline operation, you need to set the preGenerateRoot bean property of the Active Delivery Server bean to the URI of the desired root page. The URI must be entered in the format of the set resourceUriFormat (see Section 4.3). It must not contain the prefix '/coremedia/generator'.


The following section from config.bsh configures the ADS so that it generates all pages which can be reached directly or indirectly from /Site/index.html. The property setter can be called multiple times, thus configuring multiple root pages.
