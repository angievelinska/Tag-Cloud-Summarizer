Layout and naming of the Spring configuration files follows a specific pattern. In principle, the framework configuration files are located in a jar-file named <xxx>-config.jar below the framework/spring/ directory. The custom files on the other hand are located in the file system below the spring/ directory.

The spring/ directory is reserved for the actual CoreMedia component, such as the CAE web application. You can use an arbitrary sub directory spring/myproject/ for project specific configurations or extensions.

A lookup mechanism automatically loads all configuration files in the spring/ directory and below. The files are loaded in a determined order:

Framework configurations are loaded before custom configurations.
Configurations from the /spring directory are loaded before the files from its sub folders.

Later loaded configurations have always precedence over the earlier loaded ones. This is important, if a bean property is defined in more than one file. In this case, the later loaded entry overrides the earlier loaded one.

A configuration file should contain related single configurations, the file cae-mbeans.xml for example contains all MBeans used in the application. The example shows, that configuration files are named following the pattern <component>-<name>.xml. <name> denominates the content, while <component> defines the sub component for which the configuration is used.
