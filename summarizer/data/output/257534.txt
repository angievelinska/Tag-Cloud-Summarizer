The Overview window of the WebEditor consists of three main parts: the folder overview (5), the document overview (4) and the detail view (6) (see illustratio).

Menu bar (1)
The menu bar shows all yet available menus. The accessible menus depend on the object (document, folder) you have chosen and your user rights. You can use the menu bar mainly for editing functionality and for opening additional windows.
Tool bar (2)
The tool bar allows fast access to the main functions.
Document overview (4) and title bar of the document overview (3)
The document overview shows the document in the selected folder. The documents can be sorted ascending or descending by document type, document name, creation date and version. A double click on a document opens it in a separate document window.
Folder overview (5)
You can use the folder overview to inspect and edit the folder structure.
Detail view (6)
The detail view shows the content of the selected document in the selected version. In addition, you can edit the document in the detail view.
