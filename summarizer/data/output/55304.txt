<wage:selectStyle>

Renders a drop down box which lets you select a style attribute for the selection in a rich text editing component. Extends the Struts SelectTag, so you can also use other attributes defined for that tag. Attributes:

styleGroup (required): name of the style group (i.e. "list-item")
targetTag (optional): tag to which a selected style attribute should be applied (i.e. "<li>" for the "list-item" style group), defaults to "inline"
