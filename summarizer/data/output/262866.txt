You have to distinguish between the first server start after installation and all later starts.

First CM Server start

Before you start the CM Server for the first time, make sure that the document type definition file (<xyz>-doctypes.xml) can be found at the location configured with the parameter cap.server.documentTypes in the file capserver.properties. Normally this file is placed in the directory config/contentserver/doctypes. You may point this parameter to multiple comma separated paths, which may contain Ant-style wildcards. If you want to use separate table spaces for BLOB-data, you have to adapt the <DBname>.properties file of your database before the first start of the Content Server. See section for details.
