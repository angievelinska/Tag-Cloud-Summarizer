If

Grammar: ( (Variable | AggregationVariable)*, Condition, Then, Else ) 

An If task determines the successor task based on the result of a Condition. A condition may be based on the state of workflow variables, the content of documents from a Content Management Server or the external state of third party products. 

If the condition evaluates to true, the successor of the Then element is chosen, else the one of the Else element. See Else.
