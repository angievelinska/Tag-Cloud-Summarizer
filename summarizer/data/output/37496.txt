The predefined publication workflows have some features in common, which are described in the following:

Users and Groups

In order to execute tasks within workflows, users have to be assigned to special groups. In the predefined publication workflows, these are the following:
composer-role: to be able to create (and start) a publication workflow and compose a change set
approver-role: to be able to approve the resources in the change set
publisher-role: to be able to publish the resources in the change set

Special groups can be defined and linked to the workflow via the Grant element in the workflow definition file. Read more about users, groups and administration in the Administration Manual.

Note that, when all eligible users for a task reject that task, the task is again offered to all eligible users. So if you are the only user for a approver-role group and you start a publication workflow, the second step of the workflow will be escalated. That is because you cannot be the composer and the approver of a resource - and there is no other user than you.
