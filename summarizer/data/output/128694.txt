You can use this element to define your own ResourceNamingFactory. This factory creates and modifies names of resources and folders. This is intended to enable customization of how resources and folders are named or renamed in different projects or to check for allowed resource names (see the API documentation for details). Own resource naming factory classes must implement ResourceNamingFactory or extend BasicResourceNamingFactory.
