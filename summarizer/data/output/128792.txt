log.action.1.selectors=debug

Log "info" level messages from all logs in a file:

The file is saved as var/logs/capserver.log . After reaching a size of 4MB (checked after every 1000 write operations), the file is closed and a new file is created.

log.action.2.class=FileAction
log.action.2.selectors=info
log.action.2.initArgs=file=var/logs/capserver.log, 
fileSize=4000, writeOps=1000

Send emails with "critical" level messages from all logs :

An e-mail is sent with every "critical" log message. The recipient is "admin@customer.com", the sender is "coremedia@customer.com", the SMTP host is "mailserver01" and a copy is sent to "operator@customer.com".

log.action.3.class=MailAction
log.action.3.selectors=critical
log.action.3.initArgs=to=admin@customer.com, 
from=coremedia@customer.com, smtp.host=mailserver01,
