A renderer is used to render the table cells of the document table view in the Explorer, Workflow, Query and ResourceChooser window.


Class to subclass


In order to create your own renderer class you need to subclass the abstract hox.corem.editor.toolkit.table.columnrenderer.LayoutColumnRenderer class and implement the following two methods:




getComponent



3* This method returns the JComponent which will be used for the table cell. The method is called without parameters.



customizeComponent



3* This method is called with the JComponent returned from getComponent and an Object which contains the data to render. The actual object which will be passed to the method depends on the window for which the renderer is defined. In the Explorer window a ResourceHolder is passed and in the Workflow window a WfInstance is passed to the method.
