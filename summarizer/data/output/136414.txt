You can also create a connection without opening it immediately. Here you may pass a number of parameters by means of a map, but you can set additional parameters later before opening the connection.

Map params = Collections.singletonMap(Cap.CONTENT_SERVER_URL,
 "http://localhost:44441/coremedia/ior");
CapConnection connection = Cap.prepare(params);
connection.setUser("admin");
connection.setPassword("admin");
connection.open();

The methods that are available for setting the parameters of a connection are 

setUrl(..), 
setUser(...), 
setDomain(...), and 
setPassword(...).
