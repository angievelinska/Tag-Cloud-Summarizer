Passing Parameters as a Map

When you want to pass more parameters than available to the standard login methods or when you want to determine the parameters in a more flexible way, you can pass a java.util.Map to the login method. The keys must be chosen from a number of constants defined in the class Cap. The values in the map are normally strings.

Map<String,?> params = new HashMap<String,?>();
params.put(Cap.CONTENT_SERVER_URL,
  "http://localhost:44441/coremedia/ior");
params.put(Cap.WORKFLOW_SERVER_URL,
  "http://localhost:44450/workflow/ior");
params.put(Cap.USER, "admin");
params.put(Cap.DOMAIN, "");
params.put(Cap.PASSWORD, "admin");
CapConnection connection = Cap.connect(params);

In the previous example, you can see that the initial workflow server URL is passed as one parameter. Normally this is not required, because the Content Server acts as a naming service and provides the necessary information for connecting to other servers. However, in complex setups with multiple firewalls and connection redirection, it may be necessary that different clients connect via different URLs.

In the following, we summarize the available properties.
