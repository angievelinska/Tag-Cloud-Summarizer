The CoreMedia Lightweight Portal supports the Java Portlet Specification Version 2.0 (JSR 286) with some limitations, including events, public render parameters, response properties, resource requests and portlet filters, with the following limitations:

portlet modes VIEW, HELP, and EDIT are supported
window states NORMAL, MINIMIZED and MAXIMIZED are supported
custom window states are not supported.
user roles are not available (PortletRequest.isUserInRole always returns false).
only mime type text/html is supported for portal pages.
a CC/PP profile is not provided.


the following elements in the portlet.xml are ignored: 

description
display-name
The keywords subelement of the portlet-info element.

Since the CoreMedia Lightweight Portal is currently targeted at designed web sites rather than emulating a window system, the CLiP does not show the following usual portal behaviour suggested by the Java Portlet Specification:

portlet window controls - it is assumed that on a live web site, no window frames will be desired, therefore window controls are considered an editorial utility only. Currently, the frame always shows controls for all modes and states, even if not possible or supported by the portlet.
no CSS styles for the portlet style classes are defined. You can however use the Starter Kit CSS importer to import project-specific style sheets.

Some optional features of the Portlet standard are not supported, including:

shared resource QNames (ResourceURL.SHARED)
container events
the browser back button
