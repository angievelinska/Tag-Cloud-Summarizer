The Search Engine Feeder sends a batch when one of the following three conditions is fulfilled:

The maximum number of documents in a batch has been reached.
The batch size in bytes would exceed the configured maximum if more documents were added.
The batch contains a document that is waiting for indexing longer than the configured maximum delay.

You can also configure the maximum number of open batches. An open batch is a batch that was sent by the Search Engine Feeder but was not yet persisted by the Search Engine.

Use the attribute documentDelay of the element Feeder to configure the maximum time in seconds to wait between adding a document to a batch and sending that batch. Use low values if you want changes to appear fast in the CoreMedia Search Engine.

You can configure the maximum batch size and the maximum number of open batches in the element Batches below the element FastIndex . The following example configures a maximum of 5 open batches with a maximum of 5 MB each. Each batch can contain 500 documents.

<Feeder documentDelay="10" ...>
 <FastIndex ...>
   <Batches maxOpen="5" maxBytes="5000000" maxSize="500"/>
   ...
 </FastIndex>
</Feeder>
