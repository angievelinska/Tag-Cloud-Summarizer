This element configures web browser installations for a given locale and operating system. Web extensions (see <WebExtension>) may open several web browsers (Preview) or the first matching web browser (Query Editor and Differencing). Therefore the order of <WebBrowser> elements is important.

The example above configures two Windows web browsers, one with language attribute set to `de¿. If a web extension running on German locale wants to select a browser, it should open the German browser. A precedence list defines which browser is selected.
os
language
country
no attribute

In the example above, for both browsers the os attribute has been set but the German browser is selected because it has a language attribute that matches the language of the German locale. If you delete the os attribute in the German browser configuration, the other browser will be opened.
