Configure the BLOB and SgmlText Collector and BLOB Optimizer

The Optimizer is a component which merges identical BLOBs from all documents and versions into one. To identify identical BLOBS, the Optimizer calculates a MD5 hash value for each BLOB.

The Collector is a component which erases SgmlText and BLOBs from document versions which have been deleted.
