 Property Description target A property to set or get the target object the command works on. available A read-only property that tells the framework whether the command is applicable to its current target. This lets the framework choose whether to offer the action at all. enabled A read-only property that tells the framework whether the command is currently applicable to its current target, assumed it is available. This lets the framework choose whether the corresponding component will be enabled or disabled (grayed out). For some actions, this property can also be observed using the enabledObservable property (it may be null otherwise). If the enablednessVolatile property is true, the enabled property may change its state ¿spontaneously¿, so the corresponding component should be updated on every round-trip. immediate If a command is marked immediate, possible value change events of the corresponding request have to be prevented in order not to invoke validation callbacks on any business beans' properties. execute() A method with which the framework tells the command to execute on the current target.
