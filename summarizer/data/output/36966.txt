Grant

Grammar: EMPTY 

Grant authorizes users or groups to perform actions on the process or task instance they are specified in. Grant is only defined for the predefined ACLRightsPolicy. If you implement own policies, you may parameterize the policy as you want.

One of 'user', 'userId', 'group' or 'groupId' must be set to specify the subject who is authorized to do actions.  If you use 'group' or 'user' the optional 'domain' might be used in addition.

The 'rights' are a comma-separated list of names for operations, which may be performed. The actions, defined in the WfRightsPolicy interface are: 

read, write for process and task instances; create, start, suspend, resume, abort for process instances; accept, reject, assign, complete, delegate, cancel, skip, retry for task instances
