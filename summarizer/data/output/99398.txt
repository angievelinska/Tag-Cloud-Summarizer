The dialog box for internal links in RichText fields contains the following input fields:




The Link field (1): Click on [...] to open a file chooser in which you can select the CoreMedia document to link to.


The Show field (2): You define how the link target will be shown, e.g. in a new browser window (select New) or in the same window (select Replace).


The Role field (3): You can define a role for the link which will be analyzed - project specific - by the Active Delivery Server.


The Title field (4): You can define a title for the link. This might be shown e.g. as a tool tip in the browser.


The Actuate field (5): You can define when the link should be interpreted. This can be at a mouse click (On Request) or at loading time of the page. 


The usage of the fields 2 -5 is project-specific and optional. See the W3C website for more details (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/).


Formating (6 - 10): You define the formatting of the link text. By default, the text will be shown with blue font color and underlined.
