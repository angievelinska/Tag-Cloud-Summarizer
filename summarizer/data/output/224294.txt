The CoreMedia Portal Integration is used for integrating content from a CoreMedia CMS into portals like SAP Enterprise Portal and IBM Websphere Portal. Features like single sign-on and portal specific look & feel will be supported. Contents will be displayed inside a special portlet ("portal component") as linked pages, which may be browsed by users very similar to WWW, but without leaving the portal. Editing content is possible via integrating EditingServices  in a portal adequate manner.

From a technical point of view, the user's page requests will be forwarded to a Content Application Engine (the so called "portal application") using a http based infrastructure. Contents generated by this application will be transformed inside the portlet and displayed with the portal look & feel. This will be done dependend on user's authentication, e.g. a certain user might not see the whole content.

The portal integration consists of portlets for "SAP Enterprise Portal" and "IBM Websphere Portal" which are ready for deployment. A special CAE template for easy development of portal applications is contained too.
