Although HTML and CSS are open standards, it is difficult to write pages which look the same on all relevant browsers. In order to provide a proven solution for this problem, the Starter Kit sample sites use YAML for the layout. 

YAML (Yet Another Multicolumn Layout, http://www.yaml.de/en/home.html) is an (X)HTML/CSS framework which provides a flexible HTML/CSS page layout structure proven to work with most browsers. Up to three columns can be arranged according to your needs. Even "subcolumns", i.e. columns within a column, are possible and are used for two-column teaser lists in the Starter Kit example.

In the Starter Kit CSS files are maintained as ordinary CoreMedia CMS documents of type CMCSS and CMImage for images. These files are located in the /Sites/css/ folder. The substructure corresponds to the project structure suggested in the YAML documentation. When starting with your own layout, you should copy at least the folder /Sites/css/css. The original YAML CSS documents should never be edited, but only imported. The Starter Kit sample content contains the current YAML style sheets, and you can easily adopt the style sheets of later YAML versions with the css-importer (see css-importer for details) which is also part of the Starter Kit.

A YAML style sheet always consists of a browser-independent part and an Internet Explorer patch part. To use the YAML examples contained in the content repository, you have to link both corresponding parts or insert a link in the browser-independent part's "include" link list that refers to its patch part, so that you can include just the browser-independent part.

Example 

In your root channel document, add links to the following "Cascading Style Sheet" documents in the "CSS" property:

/Sites/css/examples/04_layouts_styling/css/
layout_3col_faux_columns.css
/Sites/css/examples/04_layouts_styling/css/patches/
patch_3col_faux_columns.css

The field "ieExpression" in the CMCSS documents automatically takes care of patch CSSs only being applied in Internet Explorer. Note that the flag only works when a CSS is linked in a CSS property, not when the CSS is imported by another CSS using @import with an internal link. 

Please refer to the YAML documentation or book for details about its CSS and XHTML structure and how to create custom designs based on YAML.

Reuse of existing stylesheets

Of course  the Starter Kit does not limit you to YAML.  If you already have a set of stylesheets which have been carefully designed to match your corporate identity, you can reuse them with the Starter Kit.  Simply use the css-importer to import them into CMCSS documents and include them in templates just like our YAML stylesheets.  However, you will have to spend some more effort on writing templates, because the Starter Kit sample templates are closely related to YAML (i.e. CSS class names).
