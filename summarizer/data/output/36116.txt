Variables are typed. A variable of a certain type can only contain values of its defined type or subclasses of the type.

The existing values are closely related to CoreMedia SCI property types and resource objects:



Booleans


Blobs


Contents, Folders and Documents


Content types


Dates


Exceptions
Groups and Users
Integers
Strings
Timers

All values implement the java.lang.Comparable interface. They may contain null values and are immutable. So, their setValue() methods must never be called from your own code, the result of such an action is unpredicable
