This section describes the CoreMedia Lightweight Portal (CLiP) tag library and explains how to use it. The tag library enables you to embed portlets into a page within a CAE application.

Tag Library Usage

The following code fragment shows the basic structure of a page that uses the portal tag library. Before being usable, the tag library has to be defined in the page and associated with a namespace. In this example the taglib is associated with the prefix portal.
The portal:portlet element and its children are used to render the markup of a portlet. The portlet tag defines a logical scope which enables access to the specified portlet given as CMPortletWindow and supports generating its output.
