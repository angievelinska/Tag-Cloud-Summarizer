 Parameter Description -xml [url] 

The XML-file to be transformed. The location of the file can be given as a HTTP or file URI. If the URI starts with "file://", the given prefix is removed and a normal filesystem lookup is performed. The cm script changes the working directory to $COREM_HOME. Thus the path to the XML-file must be specified relative to this directory.

Example: -xml file://properties/corem/editor.xml -xsl [url] The XSL-file used for the transformation. See above for the file lookup. -out [file] 

The output file of the transformation. The location of the file can be given as a path relative to $COREM_HOME .

Example: -out properties/corem/output.xml -mode [pretty | tidy | normal] 

The format of the output can be specified.

pretty: Indents elements and attributes in a readable way.

tidy: Removes all unnecessary whitespaces. This results in a compact format.

normal: Nothing is changed in the output file.
