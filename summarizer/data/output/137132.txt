The content repository stores versioned documents that are organized in a folder tree. It allows the user to create, retrieve, read and update stored documents and folders while checking access rights. It also ensures that content can be published from the Content Management Server to the Master Live Server.

The content repository is augmented by six services:



AccessControl for determine rights,


PublisherService for controlling the publication process,


QueryService for performing structured queries,


SearchService for performing full text searches,


PropertyService for accessing persistent properties of the Content Server,


WorkflowContentService for finding workflows that access a given content.

The PublisherService, the WorkflowContentService, and all modifying methods are only available on the Content Management Server.
