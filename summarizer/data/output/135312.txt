Although it is encouraged to use the contextinfo tag in cached fragments, the template developer should be aware that usage of the tag in cached fragments is only allowed if the fragment always relates to the same resources. This is usually the case, but some special applications may require differently. In that case, a context menu might point to the wrong repository resources.

It is not possible to attach a contextinfo tag to the <body> element of a webpage. If you need a top level contextinfo for the whole page you can surround the inner tags of the <body> tag by a contextinfo tag, e.g.

<body>
  <pbe:contextinfo ...>
   inner tags ...
   </pbe:contextinfo>
</body>
