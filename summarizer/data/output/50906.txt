In this chapter, you will learn how to extend the CoreMedia Editor with buttons and menu entries which call commands on the current selection. A command is called with a target as a parameter and it executes an operation on this target following the Command Pattern. Therefore you need to register your command at a CommandManager.

Interface to implement

All commands implement the Command interface. You need to implement (or overwrite) the execute and the isExecutable methods. The execute method gets the Context and target as parameters (see Editor API for details).

Classes to subclass

There are a different predefined commands for different tasks. You can subclass each of them (or its subclasses) for your needs. Please refer to the Editor API for details.
