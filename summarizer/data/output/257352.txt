While you have checked-out a document, no other user can check-out the document. If you want to let other users work with the document, you need to check it in. You can either:



Choose the menu item File|Check In or



click  in the tool bar.

Now the document is checked-in again and other users can check it out for editing. You can check the status of the document in the column Version of the document overview (see Kapitel for a description of the icons).
