Preconditions

Preconditions for a successful publication are:

all path information concerning the resource has to be approved too: if the resource is located in a folder never published before, this folder has to be published with the resource. So, add it to the change set or publish the folder before.
withdrawals and deletions must be approved before publication.
all documents linked to from a document which is going to be published have to be already published or included in the change set. This is because a publication that would cause dead links will not be performed.


a document which is going to be deleted must not be linked to from other documents or these documents have to be deleted during the same publication.
