CoreMedia SCI has an inheritance concept for document types and properties. In the <DocType> element, there is an optional attribute, Parent. If this attribute is set to the name of another document type, the new document type inherits all fields of its parent document. A property in the inheriting document with the same name and type as a property in the parent document will override the parent's property. You have to set the attribute Override to true in a Property element to use overriding. Overriding is only possible if it specializes the type of the property. 

Strings of the inheriting document type have to be shorter or equal, 
BLOBs a more specicific MIME type, 
XML grammars must be a child of the parents XML grammar 
and link lists a link type that is a subtype of the parent's link type. 

In addition, a document type can be defined as abstract. For it, the attribut Abstract must be set to "true" in the <DocType> element. By default, a document type is defined as not abstract. A document of abstract type cannot be created by the server,

The following example shows the document type Image and a special type, ImageWithThumbnail, which offers the field Thumbnail in addition for a reduced version of the image.
