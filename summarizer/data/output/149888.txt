The easiest way to deploy a web application into the container is to move it to the auto-deployed webapps directory of your Tomcat installation. Tomcat will automatically deploy the web application. Alternatively, an deployment .xml descriptor or the admin console can be used.

Please note, that the ADS must be deployed as an exploded application. If packaged as a .war-file, it will not run in a container that does not explode .war-files at deployment time, such as BEA Weblogic.
