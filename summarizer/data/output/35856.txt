The fourth task of the workflow is a user task called 'Publish', that will publish the changes contained in the change set. This task will be automatically accepted by the composer of the change set due to the exit action ForceUser in the 'Compose' task, that forced the performer of the 'Compose' task as the performer of the 'Publish' task.



Line 1 - 3: The user task is named "Publish" and its successor is the task "CheckPublication". The task will automatically be completed after execution of the entry actions because of the attribute autoCompleted="true". This is useful when a set of automated actions should be executed on behalf of a user. 


Line 4 - 7: The rights are granted to the user admin and the group composer-role.


Line 9 - 15: Like mentioned before, variables are defined which should be shown in the variable view of the workflow window. Nevertheless, automatically completed tasks will only be shown in the case of error in the task list. In contrast to the declaration of these variables in the Compose task no changes at all can be applied to the variables (due to Reads) and its content (due to contentEditable="false"). 


Line 17 - 22: The first action performed in the task is the predefined ApproveResource action which approves the documents given via the attribute resourceVariable.


Line 24 - 31: After executing the first entry action, the second one will be performed. Here the documents given via the attribute resourceVariable will be published by the predefined action PublishResources. The other attributes define the variables to store the publication result into, to set timeouts and to ignore publication errors only.
