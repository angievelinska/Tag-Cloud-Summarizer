Element PropertyNames

The element PropertyNames restricts the indexed properties by their name.  If it is not present, the Search Engine Feeder indexes properties with all names. The element contains a list of IncludeProperty and ExcludeProperty subelements. The first of these subelements which matches a document type and property name defines whether that property should be indexed or not. The Search Engine Feeder indexes a property only if its type is also configured for indexing in the element PropertyTypes.
