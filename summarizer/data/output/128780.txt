The possible log actions are:



StdOutAction 


Directs log messages to the "Standard Output".


FileAction 


Directs log messages to a specified log file.


MailAction 


Sends log messages as e-mail to specified receivers.

You specify log actions as values of the property log.action.<n>.class. You can configure different log actions even for the same log messages. Note that all log action properties for the same log action must have the same number <n> (see examples below).

When you start a CoreMedia installation for the first time you should always configure components with log level "debug". Later the log level can be reduced to "info" or "notice". If you then detect a problem or error, you can set the log level back to debug level and analyse the logs both on client and server side before calling the CoreMedia support.

If FileAction and MailAction are configured, certain arguments must be configured in the log.action.<n> .initArgs property. No additional arguments are required for StdOutAction.
