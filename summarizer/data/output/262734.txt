If you want to create a version of an existing document (the master) for a different language, you have two possibilities to link this document:

Link it as a localized variant to the navigation context of the master.
Link it to the appropriate navigation context of a localized version of the website. 

In both cases you can start the same:
Open the WebEditor and select the document from which you want to create a variant. Then click  in the toolbar to copy the content to the clipboard.
Select the folder, where you want to place the new document and click   in the toolbar.

If you place the copied document into the same folder as the master, the system automatically creates a document with the name "Copy of <oldDocumentName>".
