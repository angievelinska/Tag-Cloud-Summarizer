Live Environment

A Live Environment may feature two types of Live Servers: Master Live Servers and - in large-scale projects - one or more Slave Live Servers.

Modifications on the Master Live Server are sent to Slave Live Servers and replicated on their databases. Now, the content is available at the Slave Live Servers.

This architecture provides a maximum scalability and reliability. The number of Slave Live Servers can be adapted to project requirements. In case of a Slave Live Server crash, the other Live Servers take over, and in case of a Master Live Server crash, the Slave Live Servers are able to stand in.

Additionally, the Analytics Engine aggregates user data on the live-side and displays the data as reports on the production-side.
