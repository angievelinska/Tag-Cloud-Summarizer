The following CoreMedia-relevant modifications can be configured for the Java Virtual Machine in the Java_VM_Args section of the JPIF file:

The memory usage within the Java Virtual Machine can be configured using the parameters -ms<size> and -mx<size>. -ms specifies the initial object memory size and -mx the maximum object memory size. The memory requirement for the components is preconfigured and depends on the main memory size according to the standard hardware recommendations, but can be increased using this parameter if necessary.

The ORB can be configured to use a fixed CORBA port using the parameter com.sun.CORBA.ORBServerPort as described in Section.

Furthermore, the target of the log outputs of the Java process (see section 4.5) can be configured with the parameter OUTPUT_REDIRECT.

Three JPIF files cannot be invoked directly with the cm command. They are executed internally:

pre-config.jpif for installation depending settings. In this file, the parameter VERBOSE can be set to false to reduce JVM outputs. On a Unix system, the JVM to use is set in this file.
module.jpif for general environment settings for the Java programs in the CoreMedia system.
post-config.jpif for special CoreMedia JVM settings.

These files are automatically configured during the installation process. In general, these files need not be changed.
