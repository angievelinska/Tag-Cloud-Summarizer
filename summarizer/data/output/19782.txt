Column classes define how content is displayed in columns. A distinction can be made between column classes for different content:

Predefined content 
3* These classes display the content of predefined properties of a document e.g. DocumentTypeColumn, DocumentVersionColumn, ResourceDisplacementColumn and PathColumn. 
Different fields according to the document type
3* These classes display the content of document properties which are filled by the user. The column classes are configured by means of multiple child elements  <DisplayMap document='document type' property='property name'/>. The type '*' specifies a field which should be shown for all document types for which no field is explicitly given.
Content for workflows
3* These column classes display predefined content of workflows. The classes are shown in the following table.

Alternatively, a renderer can be set for each column class. The renderer carries out the display itself. For this purpose, an element, <Renderer class="Renderer class"/>  must be embedded in the ColumnDefinition element. The renderer must be a subclass of the class hox.corem.editor.toolkit.columnrenderer.LayoutColumnRenderer. See the API documentation.



The standardized column classes (IntColumn, StringColumn, DateColumn, ...) as well as DocumentTypeColumn, DocumentVersionColumn, ResourceDisplacementColumn and PathColumn define which contents are held in the columns. Sort criteria can be chosen by a click on the column title bar, indicating the content type. Another click reverses the sort order.
