If you want to copy several resources simultaneously - e.g. a folder with its contained documents - there is a feature to consider. All links inside the resource set will automatically directed to the copied resource.

Example: You want to copy documents A and B; C will not be copied. A contains a link to B and B a link to C. You paste the documents as AC and BC into a new Folder. Now AC contains a link to BC; BC links to C.

Copy resources as follows:
Select the resource(s), then

select File|copy from the menu bar or
select copy from the context menu.
