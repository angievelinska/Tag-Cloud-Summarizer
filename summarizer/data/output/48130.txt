One very important JavaScript component is the WAGE FocusManager. The FocusManager is responsible for managing the single Editor that has the focus within a given frame or frame hierarchy. It must be installed prior to any property editor.

You can install a FocusManager by calling wage_FocusManager.create(). This will create a FocusManager with the name "wage_focusManager".

The FocusManager is installed in the current frame and can later be retrieved by calling wage_FocusManager.find(). This not only tries to find a FocusManager attached to the current frame, but up the window hierarchy to the top frame. In this way it is possible to reuse one FocusManager for multiple frames.

The currently focused Editor may be retrieved with the call wage_FocusManager.find().getFocus();

You can also attach a FocusListener to the FocusManager, which will be notified whenever an editor receives or loses the focus. This can be useful for example to dynamically change which command buttons are displayed on an editing toolbar according to the currently focused Editor. A FocusListener can be attached to a FocusManager like that:
