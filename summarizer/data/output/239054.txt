The above mentioned components interacting together. How they interact and where they are deployed is described in this section. 

Two kinds of editing service use cases are distinguished: 
A pure editing services web application, and 
a PBE enabled web application.

Both alternatives uses editing services. The deployment of the pure editing services  web application consists of an editing services  web application template which is modified for portal purposes. The user access directly the editing services web application by accessing the web application with the portlet. The submitted editing forms are directly processed by the editing services framework. 

For editing services with pbe a bit more complex deployment needs to be considered. In this case the user accesses the web page inside the portlet and has the opportunity to edit content directly in the "preview". The deployment and interaction is therefore a bit more complex as in the first use case: 

The picture below shows a typical installation and interaction of a pbe enabled editing services  web application. The portlet is running in a portal and the portal application runs as a web application inside a web application container. A typical user request passes several stages which are marked by numbers in the picture.
