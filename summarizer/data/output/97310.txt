The administrator can create, edit and delete users and groups in the user manager window. All other users can change their password. The window is composed of three parts:


(1) The menu bar which gives access to all functions.


(2) The toolbar which gives easy access to the most important functions.


(3) The working part in which you edit users and groups. If more than one user or group is opened, tabs will be created for each of them.
