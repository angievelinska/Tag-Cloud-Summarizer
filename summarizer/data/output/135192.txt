Styles

To make the hover effect of the <contextinfo> tag visible you have to provide a css style "hover". When the context menu is open, the style of the contextinfo area becomes "pressed". In the following example you can see a style set for the <span> element which is included, if you don't provide an id with the <contextinfo> tag. If you provide an id you have to set the style class for the html element with the id. It may also be necessary to be more specific on the css rule, if it conflicts with other rules.

Example 4:

<head>
 <style type="text/css">
   span.hover {
     background-color: highlight;
     color: highlighttext;
   }
   span.pressed {
     background-color: highlight;
     color: highlighttext;
   }
 </style>
</head>

Be aware that stylesheets for big websites may become very complex. You may have to provide more specific css rules to get the correct hover effect. 

You may also adapt the style for the popupwindow, which is named "popupwindow". The actual menu is rendered in Resource/menu.jsp.
