When a new document is published on the Master Live Server, the replication process receives a change event and starts to read the document data from the Master Live Server. In rare cases, situations with potentially inconsistent data can arise:

In the time period between the change event and the document data transmission the relevant document is destroyed.
3* To resolve this inconsistency the replication process waits until the destruction event for the corresponding document has arrived.
The document does exist but in the time period between the change event and the document data transmission the relevant version was destroyed.
3* Since there are only two document versions on a Live Server, this can only happen during a short period during publication or if a replicator which has not been running for a long period catches up. To fix this inconsistency, the replication process waits for the publication event of the new version and the deletion of the old version. 

The replication process only resolves inconsistencies when the Slave Live Server is in "online" mode, since temporary inconsistencies must be avoided here.
