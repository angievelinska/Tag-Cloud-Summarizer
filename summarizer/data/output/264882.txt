The CoreMedia CAE web application and the taglib are shipped in a version that supports the Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 standard. This standard is supported by Tomcat 5 and other containers and introduced a number of improvements, especially EL evaluation in JSP body content. So, it is recommended to use this version. 

If you need to use CAE web applications that support the old Servlet 2.3/JSP 1.2 standard, you have to convert the web application as described below.

Converting the CAE web application template to JSP1.2

CoreMedia ships a taglib that supports the old JSP 1.2  standard, but you need to download the JSTL 1.0 distribution and adapt the templates manually:


Download the JSTL 1.0 distribution from http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_taglibs-standard-1.0.cgi and replace both jstl.jar and standard.jar in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the CAE web application template..
Change the deployment descriptor WEB-INF/web.xml from:

<web-app
  xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"
  version="2.4"> ...

to

<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems,
Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN" 
"http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">
<web-app> ...

In each JSP, change the taglib uris from



<%@ taglib
     prefix="c"
     uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
<%@ taglib
     prefix="cm"
     uri="http://www.coremedia.com/2004/objectserver-1.0-2.0" %>

to

<%@ taglib
     prefix="c"
     uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/core" %>
<%@ taglib
     prefix="cm"
     uri="http://www.coremedia.com/2004/objectserver-1.0-1.2" %>
