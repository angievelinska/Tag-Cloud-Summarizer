The dimension tables shown in the previous diagram were already discussed in conjunction with the fact tables. In the following, only the actual overlay report tables are discussed.

OverlayPageViews

This table stores in the column eventCount the number of page view events of a certain page in a given interval. Page and interval are identified by the columns pageId and eventIntervalStart. The column site redundantly stores the site to which the page under examination is associated.

OverlayPageEntries

Similarly to the table OverlayPageViews, the table OverlayPageEntries counts page view events, but the count is restricted to those events for which the page view is the first event in a session.

OverlayPageExits

Similarly to the table OverlayPageViews, the table OverlayPageExits counts page view events, but the count is restricted to those events for which the page view is the last event in a session.

OverlayContextViews

This table stores in the column eventCount the number of context view events of a certain context of a certain page in a given interval. Page, context and interval are identified by the columns pageId, pageContext and eventIntervalStart.

OverlayTransitions

This table stores in the column eventCount the number of transitions from are source page to a target page using a link in a certain context in a given interval. Source page, source context and target page are identified by the columns sourceId, sourceContext, targetId and eventIntervalStart.

OverlayTransitionExits

Similarly to the table OverlayTransitions, the table OverlayTransitionExits counts transitions, but the count is restricted to those events for which the transition is the last event in a session.
