The non-verbose output of processdefinitions shows the names and IDs of all uploaded process definitions, e.g.:

process definitions: 
  id: coremedia:///cap/processdefinition/1,
    name: ThreeStepPublication, enabled: true
  id: coremedia:///cap/processdefinition/6,
    name: SimplePublication, enabled: true
  id: coremedia:///cap/processdefinition/5,
    name: SimplePublication, enabled: false

This overview is useful to find out appropriate arguments for other server tools like start, download or enable. The IDs of the process definitions are unique. The names are not unique (see SimplePublication in the above example), but only one process definition of a certain name can be enabled at a time.

The verbose output provides detailed information about the process definitions.
