The first variant is used for entering a document via a reference. The systemId must be an URL which can be read by the importer as an InputStream, e.g. a file path.


With the second variant, the document data can be entered directly. The method returns a Result in which the data can be deposited. The parameter format determines whether the result is a DOMResult, a StreamResult or again a MultiResult. (SAX is not yet supported in this version). Valid values for format are StreamResult.FEATURE, DOMResult.FEATURE or MultiResult.FEATURE. In this variant, the systemID is not used as a data source, but, according to the JAXP concept, only as the basis for resolution of relative URLs. Depending on the result type, the generator can store the source document with DOMResult.setNode or StreamResult.setOutputStream().write, or construct a more deeply nested document hierarchy with MultiResult.addNewResult. (The nesting plays no role for the importer; it could at most be used by special transformers.)


A final example shows a simple next method which returns one file of a directory on each call.
