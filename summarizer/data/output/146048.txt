You need to create a schema for each database user, because CoreMedia CMS requires that the schema name equals the user name. Otherwise, all tables would be created in the public schema. You also have to create the schema before starting the Content Server for the first time. For example, the following commands can be used at the psql command line in order to create one database user for the Content Management Server and Workflow Server (named cm_mgmt in the example) and one database user for the Master Live Server (named cm_master in the example):

REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
CREATE USER cm_mgmt PASSWORD 'secret';
CREATE SCHEMA cm_MGMT AUTHORIZATION cm_mgmt;
CREATE USER cm_master PASSWORD 'topsecret';
CREATE SCHEMA cm_master AUTHORIZATION cm_master;

It is your choice whether you use different schemas in one database, or separate databases. Both deployment variants are supported.
