The order of the elements in the workflow definition is not relevant except for the Action and the Condition elements. The reason for this is obvious, as you have to control the order of the actions and a condition that is comparing values depends on an ordering, too. Mostly NMTOKEN is used instead of CDATA as the content model for the attributes. This restrictive policy avoids escaping of names.
