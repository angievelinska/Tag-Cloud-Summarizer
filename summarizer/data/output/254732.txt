The Content Server contains an embedded web server - Jetty - that delivers the IOR of the Content Server or the manuals for example. You can also use the web server for JMX management (see section). In order to have a secure connection, configure SSL for the server as follows:
Create a certificate using genkey as described in section for example. Make sure that the certificate name is the same as the cap.server.http.host property in contentserver.properties.
Configure the SSL connection in the file contentserver.properties in <CoreMediaHome>/properties/corem using the following properties:

cap.server.https.port - The port to use for the secure connection.
cap.server.https.keystore - The path to the Java keystore file containing the certificate.
cap.server.https.password - The password to the keystore.
cap.server.https.keypassword - The password to the server's key (often the same as the keystore password).

Now, you can connect to the embedded web server using SSL.
