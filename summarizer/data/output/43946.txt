The abstract class AbstractIconLinkFactory contains the basic functionality: the administration of enabling / disabling and the construction of the HTML fragment. The HTML fragment is parameterised by several abstract methods: 


getIconUrl() to return the URL of the icon for display of the link.

getTargetUrl() returns the URL of the link target.

getToolTip() returns the tooltip text displayed when hovering the mouse over the icon.


It is also possible to overwrite the method getTarget() in case the link should open in the same window and not in a new one (target="_blank").


The methods getGenerator() and getContextPath() can be used by subclasses to get the current ADS or its context path.
