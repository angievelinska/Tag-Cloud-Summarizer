Like the CoreMedia Editor, the WebEditor has an integrated bookmark administration but unlike the CoreMedia Editor, no Bookmarks menu exists. In addition, you can create bookmarks for your browser from the bookmarks in the Bookmarks view. Therefore, you can directly open the WebEditor from the browser and jump to the selected document or folder.

To create a bookmark, proceed as follows:
Mark the bookmark in the Bookmarks view of the WebEditor.
Open the context menu with a right-click.
Select Add to favourites from the context menu and enter the appropriate data into the opening window

Now you have created a bookmark to the document. If you select the bookmark, the Document window will open. If you are not logged on to the WebEditor the log-on screen will open firstly.
