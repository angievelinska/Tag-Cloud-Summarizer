The main goal of a content management system is to deliver the right content, to the right customer in the right time. Important requirements are:

Support of personalized content
Support of search
Integration of data from third-party systems
Integration with an existing portal solution 
Integration with delivery platforms such as Akamai
Analysis of usage
Integration of user generated content

To meet all these requirements, CoreMedia CMS contains the following components:

The Content Application Engine (CAE) with its components Http Cache, CAE Feeder and Proactive Engine to deliver and search the content.
Content Rules to deliver content, based on rules not on manual selection.
The CoreMedia Portal Integration to integrate with portals.
The Analytics Engine to analyze the usage of the content.
The Social Software Extension to integrate user generated content.

All these components have a framework character, and you can easily adapt them to your needs.
