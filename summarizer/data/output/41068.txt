For LDAP-enhanced systems, choose the appropriate domain (1). Otherwise, leave this field empty.



Enter your user name (2) and your password (3).



Click the [Login] button.


The following errors can occur:




User name or password are wrong or wrongly combined. Type in again both. Then click [Login] again.



All licenses are in use. Wait until one of your co-workers finishes and logs off, then start again. If this happens more often, buy more licenses. 



The Content Server cannot be accessed. Restart the CoreMedia Editor. If the same error occurs again, inform your system administrator.


After successful login, the Overview window opens (an administrator will see the user manager window) and you can start working.
