 Property Optimization setPageObjectCacheSize Default is 20; A higher value increases the memory consumption but also improves the performance. Use 2000 as a starting value.  setDocumentCacheSize Default is 2500; A higher value increases the memory consumption but also improves the access to CoreMedia documents. Use 20000 as a starting value setFolderCacheSize Default is 500; A higher value increases the memory consumption but also improves the access to CoreMedia documents. Use 3000 as a starting value setPageCacheSize Default is 5000; The size of the page cache will be ignored if you use a pregenerator, because all dependent pages will be generated and managed by the dependency manager. If you use a dynamic ADS use 25.000 as a starting value. If you get "out of memory" errors reduce the value. setEvictingFragments 

Default is false: Since CoreMedia SCT 4.2 a new strategy for cache eviction has been introduced. Fragments will be evicted from the cache when:

The maximum size of the page cache has been reached
The fragment has been selected by a LRU-algorithm.
The fragment is not included by other fragments

The old strategy removed a fragment from the page counter but not from the page cache when it was included by other fragments. This was error prone because the actual size of the page cache could have been bigger than the configured maximum size. This could have caused "out of memory" errors. You should only use the old strategy if you need it for compatibility reasons otherwise use always the new strategy ("false").
