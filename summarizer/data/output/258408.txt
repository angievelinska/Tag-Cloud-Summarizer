The following blob store names are predefined:

"file" for storing blob contents in the file system
"dbblob" for storing blob contents in the database table blobstore. Consult the javadoc of hox.corem.server.media.BlobStore for further details.
"zipfile" for storing blob contents in the file system in zipped format
"zipdbblob" for storing blob contents in the database table blobstore, in zipped format.
the empty string, "", for storing blob contents in the CMS tables as in previous releases.

Media store selectors are stored in the property mediaStoreSelectors of the blobstore bean. You can use the customizer tag <customize:prepend> to prepend your media store selectors to the list. The Content Server iterates over this list and the first matching condition defines the blob store to use for the specific BLOB.

If you need to, you can use the full power of spring for configuration. However, as an administrator, you only need the following beans and tags to construct your condition.

The ConditionalMediaStoreSelector is the bean which chooses the blob store to use. It has a property condition which takes the condition.

<bean>

Child elements: <property>

Parent elements: <list>, <customize:prepend>, <customize:append>

The <bean> element defines the bean which should be configured. In the context of the blob storage media store class or condition bean, which should be configured.
