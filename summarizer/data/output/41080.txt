Changes to user rights can only be made by explicitly authorized staff, but all users can change their individual passwords.


User Administration basically means to adjust profiles of:




Users: the settings for a user of the CoreMedia Server.



Groups: only groups can hold rights. The users obtain their rights by being members of a group.



Rules: give groups rights to resources.
