You can activate and deactivate In-Site Analytics by means of Preview-Based Editing (PBE) by means of the predefined PBE actions with the bean names turnInSiteAnalyticsOnAction and turnInSiteAnalyticsOffAction.

You can also activate and deactive the satellite window for setting In-Site Analytics parameters, if you have included the <analytics:satellite/> tag into your JSPs according to section. To that end, there are predefined beans turnAnalyticsSatelliteOnAction and turnAnalyticsSatelliteOffAction.

To activate both mechanisms, you can use the following XML snippet in one of your Spring configuration files:

<customize:append bean="pbeMenuActions">
  <list>
    <value>separator</value>
    <value>turnAnalyticsSatelliteOnAction</value>
    <value>turnAnalyticsSatelliteOffAction</value>
    <value>turnInSiteAnalyticsOnAction</value>
    <value>turnInSiteAnalyticsOffAction</value>
  </list>
</customize:append>
