As you can see, a Struct resembles a document which brings its own doctype declaration.  It features String, Integer, Boolean and Link properties (see section for details).  All these types come in two flavors for single values (like the linktext property in the example) or list values (like the hotLinks property).  Furthermore, there are Struct properties, which enable you to create simple nested structs and lists of structs.

While all this might sound much more flexible than the static document types, Structs have also some major drawbacks:

The editors do not support them as convenient and configurable as ordinary document type properties.
You cannot query or search for properties in Structs.

So you should not use Structs for editorial content. Structs are a powerful model for technical, programmatic issues like JSP parameters, layout related  texts and images, color schemes, sizes and the like.  By implementing cascades and fallbacks with Structs of different precedence according to some business logic you can easily achieve a site design which is both, flexible and consistent.
