Virtual machine crashes can be experienced when using certain combinations of kernel/glibc under Linux with Sun Hotspot 1.2 to 1.3. The crashes were reported to occur mostly on startup. Sun JDK 1.4 does not show the problems and neither does IBM JDK for Linux.

The problems can be fixed by reducing the default stack size. 

At bash shell, do ulimit -s 2048 
At tcsh use limit stacksize 2048 

GLIBC 2.2/Linux 2.4 users should also define an environment variable:

export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
