The CoreMedia Workflow Server provides JMX access for management and monitoring.

Two protocols are supported:

jmxmp
Hessian

jmxmp is the standard protocol for JMX but if you apply the Hessian protocol, you can use the integrated Http-Server of the Workflow Server to connect to, thus saving a port. Hessian also requires authentication, thus improving security. In addition, you can use a https connection to the web server with the Hessian protocol. Section describes how to configure an SSL connection for the integrated Http-Server.

Enabling JMX-support

In order to enable JMX-support you have to add the URL of the connection server to the property workflow.server.management.jmxremote.url  in the workflowserver.properties  file.
