The site dimension table shown in the previous diagram was already discussed in conjunction with the fact tables. In the following, only the actual permanent report tables are discussed, which are marked using the «permanent» stereotype.

You can see that all report tables contain an XX placeholder in their name. There is one of these tables for each time interval type as described in section. In the actual table name the XX is replaced by the interval type code.

UniqueVisitors_XX

These tables store in the column eventCount the number of distinct identifiable visitors who viewed a certain site in a given interval. Site and interval are identified by the columns site and eventIntervalStart.

TotalAnonymousViews_XX

These tables store in the column eventCount the number of page views that could not be associated with an identifiable user for a certain site in a given interval. Site and interval are identified by the columns site and eventIntervalStart.
