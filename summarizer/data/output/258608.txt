A CMS application which bases on the Spring framework, normally contains a lot of Spring configuration files. Each file defines multiple components or beans which are part of specific aspects of the application. In order to get an overview of the whole application, you need sometimes an overview of all beans and their interactions. For this use case, CoreMedia uses and enhances the open source software Spring BeanDoc (http://spring-beandoc.sourceforge.net). This software allows you - in analogy to Javadoc - to generate html overview pages from your bean configuration files. For each CMS Spring application CoreMedia creates such documentation based on the custom and framework configuration files.

Bean annotations

In general, framework configurations are not intended to be changed in a project. On the other hand, single framework beans can be used in the custom configuration as a service. There are also cases where it might be useful to configure a framework bean (e.g. in the sense of a hook) using a Customizer.

In order to communicate these aspects of a framework bean, CoreMedia defined a set of bean annotations. Similar to annotations in Java, these annotations are tags which can be added to the bean's description (<description>) in the bean configuration file. These annotations are not automatically analyzed, but are simply conventions to mark beans.

The following annotations are defined:
