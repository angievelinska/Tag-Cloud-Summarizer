This Section of the User Manual outlines the functionality and handling of the WebEditor.


The WebEditor is both in interface and functionality modeled after the CoreMedia Editor. But the CoreMedia Editor is a stand-alone application (a so-called rich client) and the WebEditor is a web application which runs in the browser. Thereby, differences in the functional range, usage and performance can occur. This part of the manual focuses on these differences.
