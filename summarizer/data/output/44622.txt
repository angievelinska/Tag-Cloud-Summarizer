Case 1: The document with the internal ID "pic1" is also contained in the import group: the link is valid.

Case 2: A document with the internal ID "not_here" is not contained in the import group. It cannot be  a target ID either, because it is not a numerical:  the import would therefore fail.

Case 3: If, at the time of the import, there is already a document with the ID 2468 in the repository, then the link is correct, otherwise the import would fail.

Case 4: A document with the internal ID "3456" is not contained in the import group. If, at the time of the import, there is already a document with the ID "3456" in the repository, then the link is correct, otherwise the import would fail.

The documents to import can be distributed over multiple XML files. Documents which are connected via a reference do not necessarily have to be in the same file. It is only important that all files with referenced documents are available at the start of the import process.
