Tasks define the steps a workflow process must complete. A task is identified by its name. Like a process is a template for concrete process instances, a task is a template for concrete task instances. Tasks refer to each others by the name(s) of their Successor(s). Each task must either have at least one successor or be final. 

The description of the task is a human readable explanation about what the task does. It may be localized by the editor or used as a key for localization in the CoreMedia Editor.

Tasks which finish a workflow process are declared final. There has to be at least one task in a process definition which is final. Only UserTasks and AutomatedTasks can be final. 

Variables in the task scope define the local state of task instances. This does not restrict the visibility of the variables.  A variable in a task may always be referred to from other tasks by prefixing the variable name with the task name and a dot. 

There are nine task types:

An AutomatedTask is executed automatically.
A UserTask has to be carried out by a user.


The other task types are used to control the flow of execution of tasks.
