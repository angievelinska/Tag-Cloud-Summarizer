The Bundle element of the XML file defines the bundle file to use for localizing the CoreMedia Editor and for user defined properties. The file defined in the Bundle element, will be looked up by the CoreMedia Editor and will overwrite the default values. For the bundle shown in the example above, the following file has to be created in the classpath (<CMInstallationDirectory>/classes):



my/bundle.properties for german localization


my/bundle_en.properties for english localization 

In this file, name/value pairs in the format my-column-title=My Column title are used. If "my-column-title" matches the value of an attribut name in the element <ColumnDefinition>, then "My Column title" would be the name of a column shown in the CoreMedia Editor. It is also possible to store bundle files for other languages simultaneously. For example, you can store the english names in a file bundle_en.properties. More details can be found in Section 5.8.1.6.  As a default, this element is used in the editor-startup.xml file.
