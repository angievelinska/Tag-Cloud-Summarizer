System Components

A CoreMedia SCI System has the following components and features:

Content Management Environment

The Content Management Environment  may consist of ContentManagementServer, Workflow Server, the CoreMedia Search Engine a Preview ADS, a Preview CAE supporting editing functionality with Editing Services for JSF , the Analytics Engine, the Differencing Engine, the editors and importers. Connected to a database, it keeps the current documents as well as the recycle bin, an archive for the storage of deleted documents.

CoreMedia Editor
3* The CoreMedia Editor provides a graphical user interface to create and edit documents in the production environment. Furthermore, it features workflow management for editorial processes, user administration for access to documents, document status and version management, hyperlink management as well as web preview for the online appearance of content.
CoreMedia Differencing Engine
3* The CoreMedia Differencing Engine, a new feature of CoreMedia CMS 2006, is a web application that computes the difference of two document versions. A user who displays a document in a CoreMedia Editor can start a web browser to show the differences between two document versions. 

CoreMedia Web Editing Server
3* The Web Editing Server combines access to the CoreMedia repository without using the CoreMedia Editor. It runs the so-called Web-Application Generator Extensions (WAGE) and is thus capable of modifying the SCI repository and participate in workflows. It plays out Web forms and DHTML pages that allow the user to interactively change document properties, create new folders and documents, accept offered tasks, modify workflow variables, and so on. It offers a framework which consist of server-side components (an extension to the Generator API and controller components based on Jakarta Struts) and client-side components (based on DHTML / JavaScript) that are reusable and flexibly adaptable to the Web application's needs. In addition, it supports the WebEditor which can be seen as the Web equivalent of the CoreMedia Editor. It is a browser-based editing tool that comes with limited functionality (without user administration features) but has all advantages of not having to install a client on a local disc. As a third functionality the CoreMedia Web Editing Server offers WebDAV support.
Importer
3* Content from external sources can be imported into the production system. A freely adaptable importer framework based on JAXP is used to build content sets and pipelines and to invoke content transformations, using XSL, DOM and Streams.
Workflow Server
3* Depending on whether you have purchased the single workflow or the unlimited edition of the CoreMedia Workflow Server, you can install a single workflow or an unlimited number of workflows. In both cases, the Workflow Server administrates all workflows. The Workflow Server is used to approve and publish resources.

Content Delivery Environment

The Content Delivery Environment may consist of the Master Live Server, several Replication Live Servers (which are optional), the Active Delivery Server, the ProActive Delivery Server, the CoreMedia Content Application Engine the Search Engine and the Analytics Engine. It holds the approved and published online data.

Replication Live Server
The optional Replication Live Servers replicate the content of the Master Live Server in order to enhance reliability and scalable performance.
Active Delivery Server
HTML pages are created with the CoreMedia Active Delivery Server and CoreMedia Templates (in the following also: templates) - content and layout are combined for publication in the Internet by the ADS. The templates are based on the Java Server Pages standard and provide the basis for layout. They can display both static and dynamic content. This technology allows to generate different export formats (XML, WML, PDF, etc.).
CoreMedia Content Application Engine
The CoreMedia Content Application Engine represents a stack for building client applications with CoreMedia CMS. It is a web-applications framework which allows fast development of highly dynamic, supportable and personalizable applications. It also allows to create editing applications using Editing Services for JSF.
Portal Server Integration
You can embed content from the CoreMedia repository into portal servers. The Portal Server Integration allows to edit content right in the portal. Please see the Content Applications Developer Manual for details.
ProActive Delivery Server
The CoreMedia ProActive Delivery Server (PADS) is a web application which creates output data like HTML pages each time new content becomes available through a publication. This complements the more common use-case of the CoreMedia Active Delivery Server, where rendering is triggered by requests for uncached pages.

Shared Components

CoreMedia Search Engine
A CoreMedia CMS system contains an integrated FAST search engine which can be used from the editors on content management site and from the applications on content delivery site. E.g. the editor can perform a fast full text search in the complete repository.
CoreMedia Web Services Engine
The Web Services Engine allows access to the CoreMedia system using Web Services. It can be used on production side, e.g. to program own clients and on live side.
Analytics Engine
The CoreMedia Analytics Engine extends an existing CoreMedia Content Management and Content Delivery Environment with capabilities to analyze visitor activity on produced sites and to report on the management environment's status. It comprises In-Site Analytics for the fine-grained and prompt visualization of current site visitor activity and an Analytics Dashboard for long-term, drillable compilations of site visitor activity and repository status overviews. These two distinct applications provide users with an encompassing overview of site activities.

Technologies

The following technologies are featured by CoreMedia Smart Content Technology:

WebDAV
3* The CoreMedia SCI supports WebDAV. This support allows you to edit content with WebDAV-enabled applications such as Photoshop, GoLive, etc.
3* WebDAV, Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning, is an IETF standard set of platform-independent extensions to HTTP that allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote Web servers. WebDAV features XML properties on metadata, locking - which prevents authors from overwriting each other's changes - namespace manipulation and remote file management.
LDAP
3* The CoreMedia SCI supports LDAP server for user management.
3* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a set of protocols for accessing information directories. It is based on the standards within the X.500 standard, but is significantly simpler. Unlike X.500, LDAP supports TCP/IP, which is necessary for any type of Internet access. Because it's a simpler version of X.500, LDAP is sometimes called X.500-lite.
.NET
CoreMedia SCI allows to integrate .NET applications.
.NET is software for connecting information, people, systems and devices developed by Microsoft. .NET provides XML-based interoperability.
Web Services
You may access CoreMedia SCT functionality via Web Services.

Communication

Communication between the individual components on both the production side and the Live Server is performed via CORBA. The Production and Live Systems can be secured with a Firewall if the servers are located on different computers. The server contact the databases over a JDBC interface.

Processing

On the production side of the CoreMedia system, content is created and edited with the editors, with custom clients or imported by the importers. Once editing or import of documents is completed, they are approved and published via the CoreMedia Workflow. During the publication process, the content is put online onto the Master Live Server. If  available, Replication Live Servers get noticed and reproduce the changes. Then the content is put online by the Replication Live Server.

The ADS in connection with the web server or the Content Application Engine creates HTML pages or any other format (WML, XML, PDF, etc.) from the content and CoreMedia templates. Usage of the pages generated by the CAE could be analyzed using the Analytics Engine.
