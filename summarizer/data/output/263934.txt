All properties can be used as single values or as lists, selected with the Cardinality combo box.

Type guessing

The best way to define the type of a property, is to explicitly type this property with the help of the Type combo box. On the one hand, you have to do it for lists anyway on the other hand it provides you with the type icons known from the CoreMedia editors. Nevertheless, the Struct editor is also able to "guess" the type of a property for your convenience.

numberOfLines=10 would give you an integer property
numberOfLines=ten would give you a string property
numberOfLines=true would give you a boolean property
numberOfLines=<TextMarkedAsInternalLink> would give you a link property

If you use type guessing, you will see no type icons before you check-in the document. If the tabbed variant of the Struct editor is enabled in your system, you can switch to the XML tab in order to check the created XML. The type guessing has some implications for empty properties used for a template as shown table.
