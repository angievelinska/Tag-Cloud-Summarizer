Less

Grammar: ( (Expression) , (Expression) ) 

A Less expression contains exactly two subexpressions, which are both evaluated during the evaluation of the Less expression. The expression evaluates to "true" if and only if the computed value of the first sub-expression is less than the value of the second sub-expression.

Although a Less expression may compare values of any type, this element makes sense only for integer, string, date, and timer values as defined in the workflow.
