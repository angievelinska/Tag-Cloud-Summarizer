The following information is replicated from the Master Liver Server:

created folders
created documents
created document versions
destruction of document versions
destruction of documents
renaming/moving of documents and folders

Certain information is not replicated:

document editing state: By definition, there are only documents with state "published" on the Master Live Server. Nevertheless the flags for approved and published still exist on the Master Live Server, but get lost during replication.


document types: Any changes in the document type definitions must be carried out by hand on all server instances.


user and group data: Any changes must be carried out by hand on all server instances.
