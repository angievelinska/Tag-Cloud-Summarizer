The menu bar's activated resp. visible items depend on the current task and focus as well as user's rights: 

A selected Title document will display other items in the menu bar than a complex document that holds a multimedia object. Apart from some system document types, they are highly project-specific anyway.
A staff editor will have less options to process a document than a chief editor, a sports editor will edit and process different documents than somebody from the financial department.



That's why some of the items listed here might not be activated or visible in your CoreMedia project.
