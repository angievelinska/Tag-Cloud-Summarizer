This section describes concepts and structure of the CoreMedia CAE Feeder and contains information about how to make content beans of the Content Application Engine (CAE) searchable with the CoreMedia Search Engine. For installation and administration tasks of the CAE Feeder, see the CoreMedia CMS Administration and Operation Manual, Section "CAE Feeder". For details about the CoreMedia Search Engine start with the "CoreMedia Search Engine"-chapter of the Administration and Operation Manual.

The CoreMedia Content Server contains the Search Engine Feeder, which sends CoreMedia documents to be indexed to the Search Engine. This makes it possible to search for documents in the CoreMedia Editor, WebEditor and custom content applications. Content applications on the other hand, often require search functionality not only for single documents but for content beans. The CAE Feeder makes content beans searchable by sending their data to the Search Engine, which adds it to the index. The release provides an extensible CAE Feeder template as a starting point. The CAE Feeder template is a standalone application, which can share the content bean code with an existing CAE-based web application. The CAE Feeder template employs the CoreMedia Proactive Engine to proactively send data to the Search Engine after new content beans were added, changed or removed. The Proactive Engine is described in Section ¿Proactive Engine¿. Alternatively, you can use the CAE Feeder without Proactive Engine to develop custom applications using its public API.

Section "Concepts and Architecture" describes the concepts and architecture of the CAE Feeder.
Section "Index Content Beans" describes the extensible CAE Feeder template and how to use it to make content beans searchable.
Section "CAE Feeder for API Use" describes how to set up a CAE Feeder to develop custom applications using its public API.

This manual contains an example how to use the CAE Feeder to implement search functionality for a simple web application in Section "Search".
