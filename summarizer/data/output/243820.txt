IsDocumentVersion

Grammar: EMPTY 

IsDocumentVersion queries whether a resource value contained in the variable, which is given as in Get, is a document with an explicit version.

This is helpful because document variables may refer simply to a document or to a specific version of that document, so that processing may have to vary depending on the kind of value stored.
