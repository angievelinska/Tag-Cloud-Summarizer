XML has evolved into a widespread data exchange format not only for content management systems. A wide variety of applications support XML as their data exchange format of choice. There is a rich selection of applications and tools that make it easy and cost effective to process XML.

The latest version of the XML specification can always be found on the W3C web server:

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml

There are two XML APIs: SAX and DOM, both of which are supported by Java:

The Simple API for XML (SAX) is an event-based architecture that communicates XML related events to an application.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-based API that models XML documents as trees. 

Refer to the API documentation along with this chapter to learn how to create and process XML with the CoreMedia System effectively.
