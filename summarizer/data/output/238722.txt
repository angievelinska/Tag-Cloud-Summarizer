Variable placeholders can be used within the localized sentence. They are denoted as {variableName}. Variable placeholders must match report definition variables by name. no explanationKey Purpose: Override the report definitions` explanation.

Use the property 'chartCustomizers'. no initialVariableValues A map of variable initial values. Each entry maps the variable name to the variable¿s initial value. Each value is represented by its symbolic name. The variable name must be defined in the report definition that this report view is based on, the initial value identifier must be a valid symbolic name of a value of the given variable type. See variable types for their values' symbolic names. no nonModifiableVariablesCSV 

A comma-separated list of report variables that are immutable by the user, i.e. the user cannot change the initial value. Leaving this property empty implies that all report variables are interactively changeable by the user.

The special identifier '*' can be used to denote that all variables defined in the report definition should be fixed. no filterVariableValues 

Purpose: Variable values can be filtered for a given report view. Only a subset of all available values can then be selected by the user. Filter expressions allow single values to be filtered out or all values except a list of values to be filtered. See examples below.



a) In order to filter out single values, use the filter expression ¿filter:<value>`. Use the value¿s symbolic name. Example (filtering site ¿MySite`):

<property name="filterVariableValues">
  <map>
    <entry key="site">
      <list>
         <value>filter:MySite</value>
      </list>
    </entry>
  </map>
</property>



b) In order to filter all but a few values, first filter all values ¿filter:*` and then unfilter the selected ones ¿unfilter:<value>`. Example (filtering all sites but ¿MySite`):

<property name="filterVariableValues">
  <map>
    <entry key="site">
      <list>
         <value>filter:*</value>
         <value>unfilter:MySite</value>
      </list>
    </entry>
  </map>
</property> no
