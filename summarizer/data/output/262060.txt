At rendering time you can call the aspect access methods of its corresponding content bean from all templates. By including the aspect content bean the normal template dispatching of the CAE is applied. Within the template of the aspect it is then possible to access all attached properties.

Example

<c:forEach var="aspect" items="${self.aspects}">    
  <cm:include self="${aspect}" view="asDetail"/>    
</c:forEach>  


With the pattern shown above all aspects that are registered for the current content bean (self) are included. The following pattern instead, would only include aspects from a specific Plug-In, but only if an aspect exist.

<c:if test="${not empty self.aspectByName.acme}">   
  <cm:include self="${self.aspectByName.acme}"/>   
</c:if>
