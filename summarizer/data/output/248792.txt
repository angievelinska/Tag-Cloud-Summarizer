If IMG tags are created on a website, it is recommended to enter the width and height of the image in the tag to accelerate image construction in the browser. In principle, there are three ways to achieve this:
A standard Imagesize is fixed.
A template is written which automatically scales the images to the desired size.
A template is written which outputs the image size of the blob.

In the simplest case, a standard image size is fixed. The editors take care only to save images with the fixed size in the corresponding blob property. In the templates, then, the size can be explicitly written into the static HTML text. This is the simplest but also the least flexible solution.

A template which automatically scales JPEG images is shown in Example 4.2.3.4i.
