The XML files used to configure CoreMedia SCI components are processed by the BeanParser, which is a basic part of the system. As such, it is used to 



read the license,


define document types and workflows,


configure editor, watchdog, retrieval, feeder and syndicator.

The BeanParser processes the XML files as follows:



For each XML element it tries to instantiate an object of a class, which is determined by a factory or via the class attribute. The object is created via Java Reflection and a zero-argument constructor.


If the XML element occurs inside another XML element, it tries to set the object created by the inner element on the object created by the outer element. For this, it calls a setter method and passes the object. The setter method may be named set<Element Name>(), add<ElementName>() or simply set() or add().


For each attribute of an element it calls a setter method on the object that was created when parsing the element start tag. The setter method may be named set<AttributeName>(), add<AttributeName>() or simply set() or add().

Example:

Assume the following XML file:
