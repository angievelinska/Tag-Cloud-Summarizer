Starting and initializing the Content Management Environment comprises the following steps:
Start the Content Management Server.
Start the Workflow Server.
Start the Analytics Object Analyzer.
Upload and start the Analytics Data Aggregator Workflow and if you need a publication workflow, upload the appropriate workflow.
Start the Content Management CAE Feeder.
Import the Starter Kit content.
Start the Tomcat servlet container.

1. Start the Content Management Server

Unix
Use the command line to start the server with: management/bin/cm contentserver start

Windows
If you want to run the server as a service you have to install it as a service before the first start with: management\bin\cm contentserver install


Start the server as a service with: management\bin\cm contentserver start
or
start the server not as a service with: management\bin\cm contentserver run



2. Start the Workflow Server

Unix
Use the command line to start the Workflow Server with: management/bin/cm workflowserver start

Windows
If you want to run the server as a service you have to install it as a service before the first start with: management\bin\cm workflowserver install
Start the server as a service with: management\bin\cm workflowserver start
or
start the server not as a service with: management\bin\cm workflowserver run

Do not shutdown the Workflow Server until the AggregatorManager (an component of the Data Aggregator working in the Workflow Server) and the Workflow Server are completely started (see the log-file management\var\logs\workflowserver.log for "workflow.server: Server: started (main)"), otherwise your database schema will be corrupted.



3. Start the Analytics Object Analyzer

Unix
Use the command line to start the Object Analyzer with: management/bin/cm objectanalyzer start

Windows
If you want to run the Object Analyzer as a service you have to install it as a service before the first start with: management\bin\cm objectanalyzer install
Start the Object Analyzer as a service with: management\bin\cm objectanalyzer start
or

4. Upload and Start the Analytics Data Aggregator Workflow

Upload the workflow with: management/bin/cm dataaggregator -u admin -p admin init

Start the workflow with: management/bin/cm dataaggregator -u admin -p admin start

In case you need a publication workflow you can upload it now with: management/bin upload -u admin -p admin -n <nameOfWorkflow>. See the Administrator Manual for details.

5. Start the Content Management CAE Feeder

Unix
Use the command line to start the CAE Feeder with: management/bin/cm caefeeder start

Windows
If you want to run the CAE Feeder as a service you have to install it as a service before the first start with: management\bin\cm caefeeder install


Start the CAE Feeder as a service with: management\bin\cm caefeeder start
or

6. Import the Starter Kit content

The Starter Kit is delivered with example content, that demonstrates the features of the Starter Kit. You find the content in the directory management/content.
Import the content with the serverimport tool from the command line:

management/bin/cm serverimport -u admin -p admin -r management/content


7. Start the Tomcat servlet container

Unix
Use the command line to start Tomcat with the web applications: management/jakarta-tomcat/bin/cm httpd start

Windows
If you want to run Tomcat as a service you have to install it as a service before the first start with: management\jakarta-tomcat\bin\cm httpd install
