Configuration of multi-site publishing means configuration of the publication targets. For each target the Content Management Server needs a set of properties which have to be defined in the <CoreMediaHome>/properties/corem/publisher.properties file. You have to replace <n> with a consecutive number for each property set, starting with 1. 

It is possible to change the publication target configuration after the first start of the server and even if the server is running.
