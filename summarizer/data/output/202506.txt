You can insert different special characters directly into the CoreMedia Editor using the keyboard.

Soft Break: Press <Ctrl> + <Enter> to insert a soft break.
Non-breakable Space: Press <Ctrl> + <Shift> +<Space>to insert a non-breakable space. If you place the pointer behind the non-breakable space a message will be shown in the status bar.
Other special characters: You can enter more special characters by pressing <Alt> and entering a code "0xxx" with the numeric keypad. E.g. with <Alt> + <0128> you will get the Euro symbol.

As the CoreMedia Editor supports Unicode, you can insert arbitrary characters using copy and paste. Nevertheless, these characters will only be displayed correctly if the font supports them.
