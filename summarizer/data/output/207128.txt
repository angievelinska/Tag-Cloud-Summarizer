Prerequisites

If you want to truncate the ChangeLog-table the following prerequisites should be fulfilled:

Little load on the system for example at the evening.
All clients which use the changelog are up-to-date.
New backup of the system has been made

Truncate the changelog

If you truncate the changelog you should not delete all entries. You may leave 100000 entries which is a good value proven by practice. Proceed as follows:
Get the maximum sequence number from the database using the following SQL statement:

select max(sequenceno) from changelog
2#
Delete all but the last 100000 entries from the table. Replace <LimitSequenceNo> with the maximum sequence number minus 100000:

delete from changelog where sequenceno < <LimitSequenceNo>

All but the last 100000 entries are deleted from the ChangeLog-table.
