Element PropertyTypes

The element PropertyTypes restricts the indexed properties by their type. If it is not present, the Search Engine Feeder indexes properties of all types. The element contains subelements for the different property types. If you do not want to index a certain type, you just need to leave out the subelement for that type. The Search Engine Feeder indexes a property only if its name is also configured for indexing in the element PropertyNames.
