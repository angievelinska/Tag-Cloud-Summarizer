The CoreMedia CMS is event driven. For each repository change an event is generated and send to all listeners. Listeners are for example

the Replicator of a Replication Live Server
the Workflow Server
the PADS 
indexer etc.

It is also possible to write own clients which act as listeners. 

All events are written to the ChangeLog-table in the database with a timestamp attached. Therefore a listener which was offline for a while can catch up with the current repository state by replaying all events since it was offline.
