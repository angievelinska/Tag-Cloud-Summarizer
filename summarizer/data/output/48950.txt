You can start the JmsReceiver from the command line:


bin/cm jmsreceiver start [options]


or to start the JmsReceiver as foreground process:


bin/cm jmsreceiver run [options]


The following options are supported:


-p <property.bundle>: 

3* Use a different configuration bundle for the JmsReceiver. Default is corem/jmsreceiver (which corresponds to properties/corem/jmsreceiver.properties).

-d: 

3* Do not buffer events. Without this option the uploader gets events not until a commit message marking a consistent state was received.

-r: 

3* Register a receiver but stop the service without receiving. This can be used to create a durable topic subscription only.

-i <file>: 

3* Initialize the attached uploader with all values contained in the given file before receiving starts.
