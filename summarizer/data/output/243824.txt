Join

Grammar: ( (Variable | AggregationVariable)*, Predecessor+ ) 

A Join task waits for two or more tasks to complete. Joined tasks must have been forked by a Fork task to perform execution in parallel. A Join task waits for all of them to be completed. 

The Predecessor elements contained in this element list all tasks that use this Join element as the successor. For an example see Fork.
