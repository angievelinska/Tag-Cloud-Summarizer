Defining the report state model

The report state model defines the high-level report model. It specifies the following properties (follow the 'Performance' report definition in file /framework/spring/analytics/analytics-reportdefinitions.xml in the file cap-analytics-config.jar for example):

a set of report variables - which correspond to the report parameters. Each variable defines a set of static and/or dynamic values. Values can be localized.

Additionally a state model specifies either a data model (per default state models are data model-based) or a data source feeder (the data source feeder-based state model variant is for simple reports featuring fixed SQL query statements and fixed data sources).
