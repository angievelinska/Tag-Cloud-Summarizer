The CoreMedia Content Server has several modes of operation (or run levels). These run levels determine which programs can connect to the server and which operations can be executed on the server. Each mode has the abilities of the previous mode (maintenance<administration<online). The following modes are available:

offline 
The state when the server starts, shuts down or does not run at all.
maintenance 
The server is accessible for maintenance or debugging purposes. Only the standard server tools can be used.
administration 
The server can be managed by JMX. The publisher user may log in. In the case of a Replication Live Server, replication starts.
online 
All services are active (see below). All users and clients can log in.

The following services are active in the various server run levels:

maintenance: 
3* CORBA Communication 
3* License Manager
3* Login for "admin" and "debug" services
3* Internal HTTPD to deliver the Server IOR
3* Access to resources
administration: 
3* Replicator (on Replication Live Servers)
3* Login for Publisher
online: 
3* Feeder for CoreMedia Search Engine 
3* Login for all other clients and programs, like Editor, Importer and File System View

There are two possibilities to reach a particular run level:

Start in a particular run level

3* Start the server in a particular run level with the command:
3* cm capserver start -r [maintenance | administration | online]
3* Allowed run levels are maintenance, administration and online. The default level is online.

Switch to a particular run level

3* To switch a run level in a running server, execute the command:
3* cm runlevel -u admin -r <runlevel> -g <grace period>
3* After the <grace period> (in seconds), the server changes to the run level given by <runlevel>.
3* During the grace period, you can cancel the run level switch with the following command:
3* cm runlevel -u admin -a
3* Clients logged on the server are informed at regular intervals when they will be logged out due to a "down" switch.
3* The CoreMedia Editor warns users with a dialog box when the server shuts down.
3* Shut down the server with the command cm runlevel -r offline -g <grace period>, and not with cm capserver stop.
