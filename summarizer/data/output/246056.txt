Structure of the Generated Code

When you inspect the generated classes, you will find that three files per document type are generated: 



An interface with the same name as the document type


An abstract class ending with ¿Base¿ and 


A concrete class ending with ¿Impl"

The interface is what you should use in other classes,¿*Base¿contains the repository access code and ¿*Impl¿ is the actual class that is instantiated. This class is the place for you to modify. When a document type inherits from another type, its "*Base" class inherits the "*Impl" class of its parent. This way, it inherits the custom extensions made for the supertype. For DocumentTypes that do not have a parent, the "*Base" class inherits from a framework class AbstractContentBean that defines the underlying content bean, factory, equality and hashcode as well as a few convenience methods.
