The database content of Slave Live Servers is exchangeable, i.e. it is possible to restore the database of one Slave Live Server with the database content of another Slave Live Server. Complete replication of the Master Live Server takes far longer for huge databases than restoring a database with a backup.

Execute regular database backups of a Slave Live Server
Restore the Slave Live Server database with a backup.
