A publication synchronizes the state of the Live Server with the state of the Content Management Server. All actions such as setting up new versions, deleting, moving or renaming files, withdrawing content from the live site require a publication to make the changes appear on the Live Server.

We make a distinction between the publication of structural and of content changes:



Content-related changes are changes in document versions such as a newly inserted image, modifed links, text etc.


Structure-related changes are moving, renaming, withdrawing or deleting of resources. So it becomes possible to publish structural changes separately from latest and approved document versions.

For every publication a number of changes is aggregated in a change set. This change set is normally composed in the course of a publication workflow. The administrator and other users with appropriately configured editors can also execute a direct publication, which provides a simpler, although less flexible means of creating a change set.
