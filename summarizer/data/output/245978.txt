The Spring Framework is an open source application development framework with broad functionality and features organized in several modules (see http://springframework.org/documentation). The main feature of the core module is known as dependency injection (aka Inversion of Control) implemented by bean factories to configure beans of any nature. Examples of bean factories are BeanFactory and ApplicationContext, where the latter builds on top of the first.

Like the CAE (see section Spring in CAE), Editing Services uses Spring for configuration and custom extensions, in other words for ¿plugging things together¿. All Editing Services Beans are designed to be dependency-injected by a Spring BeanFactory, typically via an XML representation. Thus, Editing Services uses an de-facto standard for configuration that is independent of a concrete view technology, since any Java view technology can use Beans. For more elaborated usages of bean factories, there are existing integration solutions with Spring and Java View Technologies, e.g. Spring-JSF. For easy development with JSF and Spring, ES provides many utilities and extensions for Spring and the existing Spring-JSF integration (see section extendJSF).
