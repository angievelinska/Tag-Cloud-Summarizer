There is no automatic recalculation of the user sets if there are changes in the user management. This may cause the following effects:

New users or users assigned to new groups won't see any offers already pending.
Users removed from groups won't see already offered task disappear from their task lists. This is not a security problem, since the rights are checked on every access on the server.
