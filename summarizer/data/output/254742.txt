If your CoreMedia Workflow Server instances are running on a Windows platform, register the CoreMedia Workflow Server as Windows service with the command 

cm workflowserver install [-a] [-u user -p password] 

as described in chapter. Start the CoreMedia Workflow Server instances with the command 

cm workflowserver start

This will also create groups required by the standard workflows. On Windows platforms you can alternatively launch the CoreMedia Workflow Servers from the corresponding Start menu item or from the Windows Services window (see chapter for details). In order to upload a workflow definition you can use the upload utility (see section).

The valid names are defined in Section 5.4.1 and have to be suffixed with .xml e.g. you have to execute 

cm upload -u admin -p <Password> -n simple-publication.xml 

if you would use the simple-publication workflow.
