Remote action handlers

A remote action handler is responsible for executing a user tasks client actions on behalf of the clients user.



Handlers must implement the interface RemoteActionHandler.


A handler receives the command and parameters to process.


It has to return an ActionResult.

A client action is the result of one of the following client calls to the server:

Task.accept()
Task.complete()
Task.retry()

The client call is blocked at least until all client actions have been handled.
