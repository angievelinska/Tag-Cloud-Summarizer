This chapter describes requirements and procedures for installation, de-installation, and starting of CoreMedia SCI:

how to install the CoreMedia system using the graphical installer is described in Section .
how to install the CoreMedia system using the script-based installer is described in Section .
how to update an existing CoreMedia system is described in Section
how to uninstall an existing CoreMedia system is described in Section
how to start an installed CoreMedia system is described in Section .

The section describes the system environment necessary for CoreMedia SCI which has to be set up first to ensure trouble-free operation of CoreMedia SCI.

CoreMedia SCI is shipped with an installation program for interactive graphical installation and configuration of the software.

An automated, script-controlled installation without graphical output for distributed installation is also possible. Basic configuration of CM components is done directly after the installation.

A standard distribution of the CoreMedia SCI consists of the following files:

cap-<rel.no.>.jar : CoreMedia SCI installer where <rel.no.> is the current release number
cap-<rel.no>-api.zip: archive for CoreMedia API Documentation
cap-<rel.no.>-html.zip: The CoreMedia manuals as HTML-files. 
cap-<rel.no.>-pdf.zip: The CoreMedia manuals as PDF-files.
cap-<rel.no.>-source.zip: Selected Java source files of the CoreMedia SCI.
cap-<rel.no>.js: a starter script for the installer with Windows Vista
readme.txt: information about the CoreMedia SCI Installer
install.script: template script file for non-GUI installation
notes.html: release notes information file
changes.html: overview of changes
cap-examples.jar: The examples from the developer manuals
cm-SearchEngine-FAST...: CoreMedia Search Engine archive files for different FAST versions and platforms in the searchengine directory.
install-webstart-win.jar : Web Start installation archive for JRE

The Installer must be executed with the same JRE/JDK used for running the components, since it automatically adjusts some configuration files of the CoreMedia system to this Java version.

A graphical installation under Unix requires an installed and running X-Server.

On UNIX OS it is recommended to set up a new user for both installation and operation of the CoreMedia system before running the installation program.

For installation, the file cap-<rel.no.>.jar is copied into a directory where the newly set up user has write/read rights. If a script-based installation is carried out, the file install.script must be configured as described in the subsection script-based installation (see Section 3.2.2).

When installing a CoreMedia Content Server, the license file should be kept ready, since it will be accessed during the installation (but you can also add it later)
