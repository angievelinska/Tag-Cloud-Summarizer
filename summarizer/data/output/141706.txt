Before you withdraw a resource, mention the following



When a folder is marked for withdrawal, all contained published resources are marked for withdrawal, too.


When a mark for withdrawal of a folder is revoked, this also affects all contained resources with the same mark.


If you use direct publication and approve a folder that is marked for withdrawal, that approval implicitly extends to the contained resources that are also marked for withdrawal.


Disapprovals extend to contained resources in the same way.

In order to withdraw a resource, proceed as follows:


Mark the resource.


Select File|Mark for withdrawal or click  in the tool bar.


Publish the resource in order to execute the withdrawal on the Live Server.

In order to revoke the withdrawal, proceed as follows:
Mark the resource.
Select File|Revoke withdrawal or click  in the tool bar.
