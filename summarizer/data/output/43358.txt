Serving web browsers always means serving HTML which is actually SGML. Most HTML documents on the web are not even conformant let alone parsable by an XML parser. 

To overcome this deficiency the W3C has issued a new version of HTML called XHTML, which is well-formed HTML. 

When using XSLT to serve content to a web browser, you'll end up serving XHTML. There're some points to keep in mind when doing this: 

Some browsers, most notably Netscape, have problems with empty tags like <b/>. Solve this problem by using an hox.text.xml.XHtmlUnparser. 
Do not forget to set the correct MimeType in your JSP: text/html
