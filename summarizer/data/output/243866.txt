Rights


Grammar: ( Grant*, Revoke*) 


The Rights elements defines user and group permissions for the workflow operations. 


You can either give the full qualified name of your own Rights class which must be an implementation of com.coremedia.workflow.WfRightsPolicy, an unqualified classname which will be searched for in the package com.coremedia.workflow.common.policies or have it default to a built-in generic implementation com.coremedia.workflow.common.policies.ACLRightsPolicy. 


The default policy ACLRightsPolicy defines an access control list like implementation:




Right can be granted to individual users or group (Grant).



Rights can be revoked for individual users or groups (Revoke).



User defined rights precede group rights.



Negative rights (revokes) precede positive rights.



The admin user has all rights (this is the user with id 0).


Specific rights are explicitly granted to the owner of the process and the performer of a task.


The process owner may:




Read and write variables exported by the processes client view.






Start the process instance.






Skip, assign and delegate any user task.






Retry the last transaction on an aborted task instance (not dependent on the policy).





The task performer may:




Read and write variables exported by the tasks client view.






Cancel or complete the accepted task instance.






Retry the last transaction if the task instance is aborted.
