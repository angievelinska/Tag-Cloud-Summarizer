When there are rights rules for live groups to be published, required groups of the built-in user management will be automatically created, but the subgroup relationships must be established separately. This is in line with the normal behaviour of the publisher.

During operation of the cm publishall tool, no changes should be made on the Content Management Server.

Even in a multi-site environment, the tool publishes all content to the Master Live Server. Afterwards, you may destroy unneeded parts of the repository with cm multisitecleanup as described in section.
