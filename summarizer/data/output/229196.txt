The CoreMedia Analytics Engine consist of multiple components that are deployed in different places:

The tracking component is deployed with a Content Application Engine (CAE). It is responsible for monitoring the traffic that arrives at the CAE. It writes special log files that contain entries for page views and for clicks on links. It also provides access to these log files for remote processes.
The Object Analyzer computes a number of properties for persistently stored objects in the repository. The properties are then written to the Analytics Database.
The Analytics Data Aggregator is a Workflow Server that is used for gathering logs from the delivery Content Application Engines and for importing these logs into the Analytics Database. A number of different databases are supported for use as the Analytics Database.
In-Site Analytics is realized inside a preview Content Application Engine that also uses the CoreMedia Editing Services for JSF for building an editing application.
The Analytics Dashboard consists of a web application that can display various summary statistics regarding the traffic on the site and the state of the content repository.
