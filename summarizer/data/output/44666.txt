While the field elements describe the contents of the document, the <action> elements define its state. Action elements have the following attributes:



name is the name of the action and can have one of the following values: publish, approve, delete. According to the DTD the edit value is allowed but the importer ignores it.


user is ignored as well. All actions are carried out by the importer user (see Administration Manual).


date, time, timezone are ignored as well.
