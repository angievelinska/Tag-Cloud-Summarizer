Because the CoreMedia Analytics Engine consists of a relatively long pipeline that gathers, consolidates and displays reporting data, the configuration of the Analytics Engine must be distributed across multiple configuration files. In particular, you can configure:

the property files of the Content Application Engine that gathers data,
the property file of the Object Analyzer,
the workflowserver.properties file that is used by the Workflow Server that runs the aggregation process, thus acting as an Analytics Data Aggregator,
the property files of the Content Application Engine that displays overlay reports,
the property files of the Analytics Dashboard web application.

For the basic configuration possibilities that apply to all CAE installations, please refer to section.

Additional configuration possibilities are also discussed in the Analytics Developer Manual.
