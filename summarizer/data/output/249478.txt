The following issues are important only if you use the Analytics Dashboard.



What Content Items will be Included in Repository Reports?



By default, the Object Analyzer gathers data about all content present in the CoreMedia repository.  If you have content which you want to exclude from reports, you can configure the system to collect information only on content you specify.

See section, especially the discussions of ContentSelector and PathAndTypeContentSelector.

How to Use Categories in Reporting?

Categories can be created to group your repository content and show content views in differently aggregated ways (for example, total views of all Sports-related content within a site).  It is a good idea to plan a category hierarchy/strategy in conjunction with your content model, as you will need to assign categories to the content items you wish to group into categories.

See section for more information about using categories.
