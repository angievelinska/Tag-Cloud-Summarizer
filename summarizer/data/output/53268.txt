Special cases

Please keep in mind that:



Older versions cannot be published. 


Example: if a version No. 4 had already been published it is not possible to publish version No. 3 thereafter. To do so, create a version No. 5 from No. 3.


During a deletion, a resource that has not been published yet is moved to the recycle bin immediately.

In addition, consult the previous tables for effects of a publication depending on the state of the resource. For all examples it is assumed that you have appropriate rights to perform the action.
