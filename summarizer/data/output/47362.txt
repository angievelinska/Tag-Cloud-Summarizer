Configuration of offline operation involves, above all, the following options which must be set in the config.bsh file:


setPreGenerateRoot: the root for generation is configured with this property. The format must correspond to that of the configured ResourceUriFormat, without prefix or host/port. The root folder page as root is therefore configured as follows:

3* generator.setPreGenerateRoot("/index.html");

setResourceUriPrefix: the namespace of the generated pages can be freely chosen; the generated pages must only be placed appropriately in the document tree of the web server. Example: all generated URIs should begin with /Site instead of /coremedia/generator:

3* generator.setResourceUriPrefix("/Site");


For passing on the generated pages, a file uploader can be used, for example.


setUploader: an implementation of the interface hox.corem.servlets.upload.FileUploader can take over the distribution of the generated pages to other computers:

3* generator.setUploader(new MyFTPUploader("www.mysite.com", "ftp", "ftp", "/usr/share/htdocs"));
