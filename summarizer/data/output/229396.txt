For test installations, the Analytics Engine and a Content Server may share a single relational database, but due to load issues, this is never advisable for production installations.

Deployment Variants

Normally the Object Analyzer should be attached to the Content Management Server, so that it can analyze unpublished content, too. It can be attached to a Live Server, however, if that is needed. When attaching it to a Live Server in a multi-site environment, you should make sure to configure it for multi-site operation as described in the Administration and Operation Manual in the Analytics configuration and operation section.

When using tracking images, it is possible to use a dedicated CAE to deliver the tracking images, routing the requests as appropriate by an upstream HTTP server. This can be helpful in isolating the load for Analytics.
