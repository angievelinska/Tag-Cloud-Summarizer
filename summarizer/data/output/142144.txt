Since CoreMedia SCI 4.2, it is no longer allowed to used the wildcard * for describing the MIME type of individual blobs. Wildcards are only allowed in document type definititions, where they indicate that any actual type string may be substituted instead.

When the system contains blobs with a wildcard MIME type like */*, you are encouraged to replace the blobs with new versions that contain the correct MIME type. Otherwise, it will not be possible to publish the associated documents. For already published blobs, the MIME type might get heuristically completed during replication, leading to inconsistencies between the documents on the Master Live Server and the replicated documents.

If you are concerned about inconsistent MIME types, you should change the offending documents and republish them. In order to locate the MIME types with wildcards, you can run the SQL query

select documentid, documentversion, propertyname 
  from blobs, blobdata 
  where target = id and mimetype like '%*%'

against the database that is used with the Master Live Server. The query will return document id and version as well as the name of the property that stores the blob that needs replacement.
