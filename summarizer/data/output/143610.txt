Once you have assigned a folder to a publication target, it must not be reassigned to another target. Doing so would result in inconsistencies between Content Mangement Server and Master Live Server.

When you configure base folders by name, a top-level folder of that name may not be renamed and no other top-level folder may be renamed to assume that name. This stops users from reassigning top-level folder accidentially. When you want to rename top-level folders that belong to a publication target, configure them using their numeric id in the file publisher.properties.
