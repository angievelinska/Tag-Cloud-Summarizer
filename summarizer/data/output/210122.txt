  Class  Description  AggregatingImageBlobEditor  

This editor displays blobs of type image/gif, image/png or image/jpeg in the property as an image. In addition, you can define other properties which contain scaled versions of the blob. This blobs will be computed from the original blob by the CoreMedia Server. The size of the scaled images is defined in the imageconverter.properties file (see the server chapter of the Administration Manual). You can use the following attributes to define scaled versions of the blob: 

onlineProperty="<PropertyName>":  Sets the name of the property which should be converted when the blob contained in the property of the AggregatingImageBlobEditor changes. The size of the image is defined with the onlineWidth and onlineHeigth properties of the imageconverter.properties file. 

originalProperty="<PropertyName>": Sets the name of the property which should be converted when the blob contained in the property of the AggregatingImageBlobEditor changes.  

thumbnailProperty="<PropertyName>":Sets the name of the property which should be converted when the blob contained in the property of the AggregatingImageBlobEditor changes. The size of the image is defined with the thumbnailWidth and thumbnailHeight properties of the imageconverter.properties file. 

Example: 

<Document type="Photo"> 

<Property name="ScannedPhoto" editorClass="AggregatingImageBlobEditor" thumbnailProperty="Preview"    onlineProperty="Online"/> 

</Document>  BasicBlobEditor  Generic editor which only displays blob size and content type. Files from the file system can be loaded and saved. Using the property WebDAVUriPrefix, the Blob can be opened directly in the associated WebDAV application. For this, the property has to be set to the URL prefix for the WebDAV server. If a prefix like http://Server:8001/webdav/ is used on a blob in a document /Inbox/Test.doc, then an URL http://Server:8001/webdav/Inbox/Test.doc for WebDAV lookup is used.  ImageBlobEditor  Displays blobs of type image/gif, image/png or image/jpeg as an image. If the size of an image exceeds the document window size, it will be scaled down. You can use the attribute imageScaledForDisplay="false" to disable the behaviour. TextBlobEditor  Allows editing of blobs of type text/* in a text field.
