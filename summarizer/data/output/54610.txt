Error behavior 

Transactions which are active at the time of failure or which first notice the failure are terminated with an error. The error is passed to the server and clients. A replicator client is terminated. Requests to Active Delivery Server clients fail with an error. Transactions started after the server has detected the database failure are blocked until a new database connection is created. Requests to Active Delivery Servers are paused. Appropriate messages are written to the server log. 

Error correction 

Because a database failure can lead to erroneously generated pages or blocked requests, the watchdog restarts the Slave Live Server. In the meantime the second Slave Live Server takes over the task of the first one. Restarting the Slave Live Server implies a brief process failure. All logged-on Active Delivery Servers are terminated. In its initialization phase, the Slave Live Server will remain paused, until the database is available again (see server log). The Active Delivery Servers cannot log on in this state. They are restarted by their watchdogs when the Slave Live Server is online again.
