Microsoft Office XP

If you have installed Microsoft Office XP on your computer, problems might occur with CoreMedia documents which have umlauts in their document name. The document names might not be shown correct and errors migth occur if you try to open such a document.

Microsoft Office 2000

If you use Office 2000 with the WebDAV server, instablities might occur if you have configured only Digest authentication. To avoid these problems you need to support Basic authentication in the server. If security is a problem you should use SSL.

Microsoft Vista

If you connect on a Windows Vista system, you might have to enter the username and password three times. This is caused by a bug in Windows Vista's WebDAV support. This does not happen if the username contains a "@" character as it is the case for LDAP users.
