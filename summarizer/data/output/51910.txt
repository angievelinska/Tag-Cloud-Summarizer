You can define some attributes for your command in a properties file. The attributes are shown in the GUI and the names must follow the scheme:


<command-name><suffix>=<value>


<Suffix> can take the following values:




Label: The text which is shown in the menus.



MenuItemLabel: The text of a menu item.



Image: The icon which is shown in the toolbar.



ToolTip: The text which is shown as a tooltip.



Mnemonic: The shortcut which can be used to start the command.


Please notice that <command-name> is not the class name of your command but the name registered at the CommandManager. So it is possible to register several commands with the same name.
