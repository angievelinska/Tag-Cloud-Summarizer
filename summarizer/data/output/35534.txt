Begin of workflow


3* This symbol marks the begin of the workflow. For this node, only outgoing transitions are allowed.


End of workflow


3* This symbol marks the end of the workflow. For this node, only incoming transitions are allowed.


Activity / Task


3* This symbol denotes an activity, which is called a task in the CoreMedia Workflow.


Subactivity state / Subworkflow


3* A separate workflow can be called from a task of another workflow. Thus the separate workflow can be called a subworkflow task.


Decision node / Branch / Choice


3* This symbol stands for a node where the control flow branches, depending on a decision. In a workflow definition, a decision-based branch is usually called an If task.


Synchronization bar


3* This symbol is used for splitting or synchronizing the control flow. In the splitting case the control flow forks in more than one follow-up task. In the synchronization case, multiple tasks executed in parallel are joined together.


Control Flow


3* Transitions specify the control flow from a node to its successor. Nodes can be any of begin or end of workflow, task, choice and synchronization bar.


Conditional Control Flow


3* Transitions can be inscribed with a condition in square brackets. Such edges are usually used as outgoing edges of a decision node (called a Choice task).


Actor with Role


3* An actor is used in UML to denote a participant in a use case. We introduce actors to specify rights of users of certain groups (roles) for user tasks.


Dependency used to assign Roles to Tasks


3* A dashed arrow denotes a UML dependency. We use special dependencies to connect roles (see above) with user tasks in order to assign rights.
