Deletion of document types is best done with a mixture of server utilities and SQL commands. Proceed as follows:
Start a query from the CoreMedia Editor to select all documents of the document type to delete.
Mark all these documents for deletion.
Publish all the document.
Use the cleanrecyclebin utility to remove all the documents from the recycle bin.
Stop the Content Management Server and the Live Servers.
Remove the document types to delete from the document types definition files of all Content Servers.
Verify that the table which represents the document type is empty.
 Drop the table which represents the document type from the databases.
Start the Content Servers again.
