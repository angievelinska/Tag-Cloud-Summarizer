The page impressions per visit report shows the average number of page impressions that make up a single visit for a given site. Only those visits are taken into account that are limited to single site.

The possible choices for variables and the offered actions for this report are identical to those of the performance report described in section, but only a single graph is shown, namely the average number of page impressions.
