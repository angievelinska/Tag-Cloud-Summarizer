PADS distinguishes between top-level and fragment values. Top-Level values (such as pages) are sent to the uploaders; fragment values are only helper values embedded into others. PADS performs a reachability-based garbage collection scheme on top-level values before every upload phase (resulting in "DELETE" events for unreachable top-level values). No such garbage collection is performed for fragments as it would slow down PADS' operation too much.

Although most unused fragments are invalidated at some point and automatically deleted, this means that your database may grow in size through unused, yet valid fragments. If database/disk size is an issue, you should therefore regularly clean the PADS database from such fragments using the fragment cleaner.
