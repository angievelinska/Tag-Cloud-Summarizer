CORBA is used for the communication between CoreMedia system components. All CoreMedia components require the IOR of the CoreMedia Server which they want to communicate with. The IOR of the CoreMedia Server will be delivered by the server via the HTTP protocol.

All components require the IOR of the CoreMedia Server with which they want to communicate. 
3* The URL where to get the IOR of the CoreMedia Server is configured with the parameter cap.client.server.ior.url=<IOR-URL> in the file capclient .properties.
3* The value of the parameter is http://<server>:<port>/coremedia/ior. Instead of <server> you have to insert the name of the computer where the server is running. Instead of <port> you have to insert the HTTP port on which the client connects to the server. Both values are defined in the capserver.properties file (see section).
3* Example: The CoreMedia Server host has the name productionserver and the capserver.properties file contains the property cap.server.http.port=44445. In this case, you can obtain the IOR with the following URL:
3* cap.client.server.ior.url=http://productionserver:44445/coremedia/ior

The CoreMedia Content/Live Server embed their own hostnames into the IOR which must be resolved by the client machines. If this is not possible by the client, you can configure the server to embed a numeric IP address into the IOR. To do so, use the property cap.server.ORBServerHost in the contentserver.properties file. In the following example, the ORB is configured to embed its numeric address:

cap.server.ORBServerHost="10.1.3.253"
