This template first includes the necessary stylesheets: apart from the stylesheet necessary for displaying rich text, there is another one (wage.css) required for editing, e.g. for correctly displaying the WAGE toolbar.

Then, the WAGE JavaScript packages that are necessary for using the WAGE FocusManager and the RichTextEditing features of WAGE are loaded.

As we are using the FocusManager only within this template and therefore it hasn't been created before, we have to install a new one by calling wage_FocusManager.create().

For RichText editing, commands (like bold or italic) have to be executed for the currently selected text. Allowing the user to choose these commands can be done by rendering a WAGE toolbar (see below).

Then, we include the actual description property for editing.

Finally, we render the usual wizard buttons.
