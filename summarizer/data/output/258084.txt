The installer is based on AntInstaller (see http://antinstaller.sourceforge.net/) and supports a silent text-mode installation. By default, the installer reads the properties from the file starterkit-install.properties in the current working directory but you can specify another file with the -p parameter. You can use a file generated by the graphical installer as an installation file.

Start the text installation as follows:

java -jar cap-starterkit-installer-5.2.<currentVersion>.jar 
text-auto [-p <PropertyFile>]
