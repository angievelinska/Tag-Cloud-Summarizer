The <analytics:namecontext> tag is used to identify a section of the page using a string-valued name.

For example, the following JSP fragment defines one link in the context ctx1 and one link in the nested context ctx1/ctx2.

<analytics:pagecontext ...>
  <analytics:namecontext name="ctx1">
    <analytics:link ...>...</analytics:link>
    <analytics:namecontext name="ctx2">
      <analytics:link ...>...</analytics:link>
    </analytics:namecontext>
  </analytics:namecontext>
</analytics:pagecontext>


By default, one rendering of an entire page is logged as a page view. However, by setting the logView attribute to true, every rendering of a name context will be written to the analytics log and will show up as a context view in the database. This is particularly useful when your pages contain variable parts like rotated teasers of session-dependent content, allowing you to track the number of times that a certain element is rendered on a page.
