Description 

name 

Name of the column which is shown in the header of the column. It may be localized as described in the Editor Developer Manual. 

class 

This attribute is used for selecting a class for displaying the column. This determines the field type which can be displayed. Furthermore, the class sorts the contents of the column. You find predefined classes in Section 4.4.4. 

width 

This attribute is used for defining the minimum width of the column in pixels. If the window width is smaller than the total sum of all column widths, a scroll bar appears. Scaling for a larger window is controlled with the attributes weight and resizable. The default value is 100 pixels. 

weight 

This attribute gives the relative weight of a column in scaling. Rational numbers are entered. The default value for all columns is "1.0". 

resizable 

This attribute is used for defining whether a column is resized at all. The default setting is "true", i.e. the column is enlarged. Resizing can be switched off with "false".
