 Property Value Default Description proxy.cache.capacity <int>  

With this parameter you can set the number of cached resources, i.e. documents and folders (default value: 2000). The default value of 2000 resources is set according to the maximum memory allocation of the Java environment of 64 MBytes (see bin/editor.jpif). Furthermore, this value is based on the assumption that a document contains a normal sized image (JPEG, GIF, etc.) and these images are displayed in the overview as thumbnails.

If the documents contain few images but their number is many thousands, the value for the cache can be e.g. doubled, while maintaining the memory size of the JVM.

If large multimedia data is involved, the upper limit of the memory allocation for the Java environment must be increased, or the cache memory size reduced according to the larger size of the data. proxy.gc.limit <int>  Using this parameter, you can enter (in bytes) the size of the remaining free memory of the JVM before CM Editor objects start to be deleted, in order to avoid a memory deficiency (default value: 1,000,000). An increase of this value to ca. 3 ~ 5 million can lead to the resource cache being almost completely emptied very often, to maintain free memory for the program execution of the CM Editor. In this way, memory deficiency can be avoided, but the network load usually increases, since the resource cache must be refilled, leading to possible losses in speed when working with the CM Editor. proxy.status.interval <int>  Using this parameter, you can determine the interval (in seconds) at which the required memory is analysed and, possibly, reduced, and messages about the resource cache and the memory use of the CM Editor are output. A value of 0 deactivates this function. proxy.entityResolver.class hox.corem.editor.proxy.ProxyEntityResolver  

The editor fetches XML-entities like css-files for RichText-properties from the CoreMedia server. You can configure a different entity resolver in order to relieve the CoreMedia Content Server. The value must be an implementation of org.xml.sax.EntityResolver. For convenience, CoreMedia SCI provides the ProxyEntityResolver which caches entities on the local disk in the <install dir> /var/tmp/editor/entities directory. If you run the CoreMedia Editor on a Windows Vista system, the entities are cached relative to the users data:

e.g.: c:\Users\bob\AppData\Local\CoreMedia\CMS\<Rel.No.>
