If you want to create the content manually, you have to start the CoreMedia Content Server, the Active Delivery Server (ADS) and the CoreMedia Editor:
1#
Enter the bin directory of the CoreMedia installation and start the CoreMedia Content Server which manages the content with ./cm capserver start

3* The start of the server will take some time. Please wait until the server is up (all services are enabled) before proceeding with the next steps.
2#
Enter the bin directory of the servlet container home directory (e.g. <InstallDirectory>/<tomcathome>). Start the CoreMedia ADS, which is needed to generate the websites using templates and content, by calling cm httpd start
Start the CoreMedia Editor, which is needed to create the actual content, with ./cm editor. Log in as user admin with password admin.

The status of the Server and Generator can be checked by using ./cm capserver status and ./cm httpd status respectively.

If problems occur always look at the log files. They reside under var/logs in the appropriate directory. You can also read the troubleshooting section of this paper (Section 8.5).

Since we did not start a workflow server, the editor log will include a number of harmless error messages documenting fruitless attempts to retrieve the task list etc.

Now the editor with the menu bar at the top, an explorer like folder overview on the left and the document overview on the right opens. Only two directories exist: Home and System. A new directory for the contents of the MenuSite must be created.
Click with the right mouse button on the top directory label with a single slash /. From the context menu select new|Folder. Name it MenuSite.
Click right on the newly created folder and create three subfolders named Meat, Fish and Poultry. Your screen should look like this:
