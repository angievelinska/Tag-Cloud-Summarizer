The CoreMedia XML Importer clients serve to transfer content from external sources into CoreMedia CMS. They can handle any XML format, and even non XML legacy formats can be transformed into importable XML files. For each different XML format you want to import, a specialized importer instance is required to transform the relevant components of the source documents into corresponding fields of CoreMedia documents. 

The importers are non-interactive and, according to their configuration, stop processing after a single import or run and import continuously at periodic intervals.

Before you start a XML Importer, it must be configured, e.g. where to get the input or the CoreMedia user name and password.

The following sections describe how to:

configure and
start/stop importers.

In the following all given file paths are relative and relate to the CoreMedia installation directory.
