 Property Value Default Description import.user String importer The name of the CoreMedia user with which the importer logs on. Make sure that the user has the rights required to carry out operations triggered by the import process, e.g. creating a new document, editing, approving, publishing. For this purpose, the standard CoreMedia installation offers a pre-defined user called importer (password also importer). import.password String importer The password of the user to log-on with. import.autoLogoutSeconds int -1 This property defines the time of inactivity in seconds after which the importer should log-off. When the importer is active again, it will log-on at the server automatically. A value of "-1" means that the importer will not log out. import.multiResultGeneratorFactory.property.sleepingSeconds int -1 An importer remains logged-on per default, whether data are imported or not. When configuring SubDirGenerators, the property defines the number of seconds for the importer to be inactive after the completion of the import. If the number of seconds is very large, it is reasonable to logout the importer automatically. In this case, the released importer licence can be used by another importer. Note that the special value "-1" will cause the importer to terminate after importing the contents of the inbox directories.
