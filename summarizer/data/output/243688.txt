This chapter is about the definition and description of workflows. Definition means that a desired workflow (or business process) is described by means of UML-activity diagrams. Then, description means the translation of a UML workflow description into a workflow XML file and probably some Java classes.

 Section 4.1 gives a short survey of how to analyze and define a workflow by means of activity diagrams  and the syntactical elements of the XML workflow description language. 
Section 4.2 describes how you can upload your workflow definition to the workflow server.
Section 4.3 gives an example on how to define a workflow.
In Section 7.1, all elements of the XML workflow description language are described as a reference.
