CoreMedia groups are highly project-specific, and their hierarchies and dependencies are modelled after the needs of the editorial team. 


A default set of groups comes with every CoreMedia system in order to enable basic functionality. These are:




admin



3* for project administration, user and rights management as well as troubleshooting,



chief editor



3* has extended access to the project, can modify the project structure,



approver



3* the explicit right to approve resources for publication and so make modifications available to the public,



importer



3* no real users: technically required for automated or manual import of content,



publisher 



3* for publication of approved resources,



editor 



3* editorial staff, has access to certain parts of the project, 



system



3* no real users, technically required.
