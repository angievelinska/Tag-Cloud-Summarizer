JPEG Transformer 

The JPEG transformer class parses the image file and outputs the DataSets in Record 2 of the JFIF file, which are described in the Importer Developer Manual. The output consists of an <image> root element with the attributes base and name and XML elements <dataset> with the attribute id for each DataSet with the DataSet content. The element attribute 'id' contains the number of the DataSet in decimal three-digit form. An incomplete list of numbers can be found in the Developer's Manual in the "JPEG Images" subsection of the "Importers" chapter and is taken from the "IPTC - NAA Information Interchange Model" (IIM) specification. For example, the DataSet number 105 stands for the heading.

JPEG XSLT Transformer

The XSLT transformer transforms the generated XML tree into the desired CoreMedia XML using the given stylesheet. The stylesheet, which is installed by the installer, is written for a certain text and image type. It is highly likely that you have to change the stylesheet in order to suit it to your document types.
