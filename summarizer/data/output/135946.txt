Element DocumentTypes

The element DocumentTypes is used to restrict the indexed documents by their type. If it is not present, the Search Engine Feeder indexes all documents. It contains a list of IncludeDocumentType and ExcludeDocumentType elements. The first of these subelements which matches a document type defines whether documents of that type will be indexed or not.
