Using the file WEB-INF/config.bsh, various options of the Active Delivery Server context can be configured. The config.bsh page is executed once when the Active Delivery Server starts and therefore behaves like a flexible configuration file. On changes to the configuration of the particular Active Delivery Server context, the Active Delivery Server must be restarted so that the changed configuration becomes active.

Using Java syntax and method commands of the generator API, options of the Active Delivery Server can be set, or extensions (Java Beans) integrated.

In general, property allocation occurs via bean setter methods:

<BeanName>.set<PropertyName>(<Value>);

i.e. 

generator.setResourceUriFormat(new NumericResourceUriFormat());
