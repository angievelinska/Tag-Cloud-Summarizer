From an administrator¿s perspective, there are two important configuration files:

config/proactiveengine/log4j.properties
config/proactiveengine/spring/proactiveengine.properties

log4j.properties

This is the configuration for the Apache Log4j based logging. As a default, the logging output will be written to a file var/logs/proactiveengine.log. See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/documentation.html  for a documentation of Log4j and its configuration options.

proactiveengine.properties

This file configures the Proactive Engine's internal and external components. These components are

Repository

The CoreMedia CMS Repository connection is specified in the usual (see above) way and looks as follows

repository.url=http://localhost:44441/coremedia/ior
repository.user=webserver
repository.password=webserver
repository.domain=

Database

A database for the Proactive Engine's internal components needs to be specified. Before entering the database parameters, you have to create a new database user as described above. Alternatively, due to the use of different tables you may reuse the same database user which you are still using for the CMS repository.
