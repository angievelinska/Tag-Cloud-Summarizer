A page view denotes the delivery of a single page to a visitor of a site. A visitor is also referred to as a user in contexts where the viewing of a page is not the primary focus. A session can often be characterized by a user. The first page view for which a user can be computed, determines the user of the session.

The count of unique visitors of a given time interval is the number of different users of sessions that contain viewed pages in the given time interval.

Transition

A transition denotes the progress of the visitor from one page to another page. A transition always corresponds to a page view, but not vice versa.

Session

A session denotes a sequence of page views. A session is terminated after a certain period of inactivity, typically after 30 minutes during which no page view occurred.

Entry

The first page view in a session is called an entry. 

Exit

The last page view in a session is called an exit. 

Stays

All page views in a session except for the last are called stays.

Loyalty

For a certain page, the percentage of page views that are followed by further page views in the same session is known as loyalty. Similarly, the loyalty for a link is computed as the percentage of transitions using this link that are followed by further page views in the same session.
