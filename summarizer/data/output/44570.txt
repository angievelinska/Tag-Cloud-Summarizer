The Extensible Markup Language, XML, is a standard for platform- and software-independent description of structured files and data published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). More and more content suppliers recognize XML as a simple yet powerful exchange format and deliver their content in XML format.

CoreMedia naturally also supports XML and provides an importer for XML files of any format and map them to your CoreMedia document types.

This chapter deals with conceptual aspects of the XML importer, in particular the configuration for any given XML format. How to put a new importer with such a configuration into operation is described in the Administration Manual.
