In this case, the only remarkable method is getValueAt(). The method selects the content bean by the given row and maps the column values to a bean property. The switch command differentiates among the document itself, its name and the creation date. It depends on the JTable and the deployed renderers how these return values are presented.

With these two models most of the work is done. The client makes some initializations and aggregates a JTree and a JTable onto one JSplitPane.

Compile and execute the client with the following commands:
Compile all source files with:
$ ant compile-client


On successful compilation, you can start the client. A window should appear allowing you to navigate through your current folders and documents.
$ ant execute-client
