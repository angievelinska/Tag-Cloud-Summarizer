 Domain / Variable type Description Time-related Variable Types  PointInTimeVariable A dynamically computed set of time stamps used to select a single point in time. Currently used in the RepositoryInformation report to select repository snapshots. TimeRangeVariable 

A dynamic set of relative and absolute time ranges. Used throughout all reports. The set of available values depends on the currently selected value. Two subtypes of TimeRangeVariable are defined. Currently defines eight values (given by their symbolic name):

r1y - the last complete full year, aligned by years (in May 2007, this is the year 2006)
r1f - the last complete half year, aligned by half years (in May 2007, this the second half of 2006)
r1q - the last complete quarter year, aligned by quarter (in May 2007, this is the first quarter of 2007)
r1m - the last complete month, aligned by month (in May 2007, this is April 2007)
r1w - the last complete week, aligned by week (depending on locale configuration, this is either last Sun-Sat (e.g., in the USA) or last Mon-Sun (e.g., in Europe)
r1mByd - the last roundabout month (28-31 days), aligned to days (on May 12th 2007, this is April 12th - May 11th)
r1wByd - the last 7 days, aligned to days (on May 12th 2007, this is May 5th - May 11th)
r1dByh - the last 24 hours, aligned to hours (on May 12th 2007, 2:15pm, this is May 11th, 2:00pm - May 12, 2:00pm) PreConsolidatedData-
TimeRangeVariable A subtype of TimeRangeVariable that is suitable for category reports working on data that is pre-aggregated and pre-consolidated by the Analytics Database. It does not define additional values. TimeSeries-
TimeRangeVariable 

A subtype of TimeRangeVariable that is suitable for time series reports. Additional to the existing eight values defined in the supertype, it defines four more values:

r6q - the last 6 complete quarters
r12m - the last 12 complete months
r6m - the last 6 complete months
r3m - the last 3 complete months TimeResolutionVariable 

A fixed set of time resolutions. Can be dynamically constrained by time range variables. It defines the following values (given by symbolic names):

y - year
f - halfyear
q - quarter
m - month
b - biweek (14 days)
w - week
d - day
h - hour Content-related Variable Types  CategoryVariable A dynamically computed set of categories. Category variable values are set up from the Analytics Database data source. ContentItemStateVariable 

A fixed set of values defining content item states that can be applied as a content item filter: Currently defines four values (given by symbolic names):

pub - select content items that are marked 'published' in the repository.
notpub - Select content items that are marked 'not published' in the repository.
exist - Select content items that are not marked 'deleted' in the repository. Subsumes published and non-published.
del - Select content items that are marked 'deleted' in the repository. ContentTypeVariable A dynamically computed set of content types. Defines a single fixed type '*' that subsumes all content types. Content type value set is set up from the Analytics Database data source. Page-related Variable Types  PageClassificationVariable 

A fixed set of page classifications (usually deduced from user actions). Currently defines two values: 

entry - Entry pages 
exit - Exit pages   Site-related Variable Types  SiteSelectionVariable A dynamically computed set of sites of a multi-site CMS. Values are computed from site information available in the Analytics Database data source. Ranking (Top N)-related Variable Types  RankRangeVariable 

A fixed set of integer intervals representing entry ranges. Currently defines ranges 1-5, 1-10, 1-15 and 1-20.

Possible extension point: Ranges can be computed dynamically and need not start with 1, thus range blocks (1-10, 11-20, ...) could easily be created. Five values are defined:

top3 - rank 1 through 3
top5 - rank 1 through 5
top10 - rank 1 through 10
top15 - rank 1 through 15
top20 - rank 1 through 20 Search-related Variable Types  SearchCollectionVariable 

The dynamic set of search collections as defined by the CoreMedia Search Engine. Search collection names are retrieved from the Analytics Database.



Technically, this variable type is based on the generic value set variable type (see below). SearchTermResolutionVariable 

A fixed set of search term resolution levels. Currently not used in any report. Defines two detail levels: 

words - single word search terms
searchterms - composite (phrases) search terms. Miscellaneous Variable Types  NumberFormatVariable 

A fixed set of values defining abstract number formats (not the actual format string). Currently defines two values: Absolute Values and relative numbers (percentages). Two values are defined:

absolute - absolute numbers
relative - relative (percentage) numbers

Technically, this variable type is based on the generic value set variable type (see below).
