Slave Live Servers have been introduced in chapter 2. This section describes them in more detail. The Slave Live Server is a complete server installation with its own database instance, like a Master Live Server installation. The Slave Live Server differs from a Master Live Server in the following points:



A Slave Live Server needs a different license file, that defines the server type (live).


For a Slave Live Server you must configure the replicator.properties file (see section).


The content of a Slave Live Server is updated in a different way. The Slave Live Server is a replicated image of the Master Live Server. It receives changes from the Master Live Server and updates its database accordingly. In particular, it can track changes after an offline phase. The process responsible for content update is called the replication process or replicator.

The following points are important:



the Active Delivery Server (ADS) no longer accesses the Master Live Server directly


you can install any number of Slave Live Servers (depending on the license)


each Slave Live Server accesses its own database instance


multiple Active Delivery Server/webserver pairs can access each Slave Live Server
