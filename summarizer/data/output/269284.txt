Both methods, getSubfolders and getDocuments, use getFolder and asContentMetaData now (see the source of file BrowserImpl.java). The service is ready now and can be compiled and deployed:
Change to the directory ws03-browser
Build and deploy the WebService with the following command:
$ ant server
Before you proceed with the client, be sure that the web application is running.
Generate the client API:
$ ant generate-client
