Each WebDAV folder which represents a CoreMedia folder contains an HTML information file that displays some additional information. The information file is not contained in WebDAV folders that represent a CoreMedia document with folder mapping. The information file contains the following:

The name of the logged in user. 
The exported document types. 
The file extensions associated with the exported document types. 
The locked documents of the user. Members of the administrator group also see documents locked by other users.
The name of the WebDAV application which locked the document. 
A list of error messages that occured during the last WebDAV requests. 
3* Errors occur if you do not have the appropriate rights (HTTP error code 403) or when problems appear during writing, for example when a string is longer than allowed by the String field.
