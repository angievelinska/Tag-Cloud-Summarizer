Disable Feeding

Set the property cap.server.feeder.enable in the file contentserver.properties to the value false to disable the Search Engine Feeder.

A disabled Search Engine Feeder does not start when the Content Server goes online and can not be started with the Search Engine Feeder administration page. Changing the configuration stops a running Search Engine Feeder.

For example:

cap.server.feeder.enable=false
