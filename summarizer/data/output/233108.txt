 Overlay element Description Upper left number Total number of page views. Change 

A change percentage based on the displayed graph. To this end, the graph is numerically approximated by a linear function. The change value is computed as the total change of this linear function over the interval divided by the greater of the values at the start and at the end of the interval.

Example: The graph is approximated by a straight line with a starting value of 350 and an end value of 550. Then, the change value is calculated as (550 - 350)/550 = 0.36. Therefore, the value in question has increased by 36% over the given time interval. Arrow The arrow visualizes the change percentage, indicating that the value is increasing (arrow up), unchanging (arrow right), or decreasing (arrow down). Entries The number of visitors in the given time frame for whom the page was the first page in the session. This value is also shown as a percentage based on the total number of page views. Exits The number of visitors for whom the current page was the last page in the session. Only page views that are old enough for the session to time out (typically 30 minutes) are counted for this value. The percentage shown is also based on the total number of page views for which the session could have timed out afterwards. Stays The number of page views such that the session was continued afterwards and  for which the session could have timed out afterwards. The percentage is computed similarly to the exit percentage. Top external referrers Those external web pages that directed the most page views at the current page. For each page it is shown how many page views resulted from links on that page. Contrary to the previous statistics, the numbers shown are always based on the last full hour that has been processed by the aggregation process.
