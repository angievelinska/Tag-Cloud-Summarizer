Configure the content bean classes in the file cae-contentbeans-example.xml, which is located in the directory <InstallRoot>/config/caefeeder/spring. The file uses the same format as the contentbeans.xml configuration file of a CAE-based web application. Section ¿Spring Configuration¿ describes how to configure content bean classes.

Make sure, that the configured classes are available in the classpath of the CAE Feeder, for example by copying a JAR file with the class files to the directory <InstallRoot>/lib.
