Unlike the merging of DocTypeAspects with their target DocTypes at startup-time, ContentBean and Aspect classes as well as their instances are always separated from each other. Due to distinct Plug-In identifiers, name clashes between different Plug-In providers are avoided. For every two Plug-Ins with the same identifier it is therefore not allowed to attach aspects to the same ContentBean.

While all contentbeans implement AspectAggregator via CMObject all aspects implement the Aspect interface or respectively extend AbstractAspectContentBean. By doing that, aspects are provided with a back link to their aggregator. The aggregating contentbean itself, provides the navigation methods getAspectByName and getAspects.
