This section describes the operational server utilities. Before you apply these tools you should read the respective documentation thorouhgly. The operational tools perform highly privileged tasks some of which are not subject to any consistency checks. An improper usage of the tools may severely affect the performance of the CoreMedia CMS or even damage the repository. 

Repository tools

collectors: Delete obsolete documents and versions from the repository
serverexport: Stores the content of the repository as XML files
serverimport: Upload content stored by serverexport
usedlicenses: Withdraws a license from a user

Database tools

sql: Provides direct access to the database
dbindex: Creates a database index over the folder structure

Server tools

killsession: Kills a session
tracesession: Causes a session to be traced
runlevel: Changes the runlevel of the server
unlockcontentserver: Remove a lock that stops a Content Server from starting up

Workflow tools

upload: Uploads a new workflow definition from an XML file
download: Stores a workflow definition from the repository in an XML file
enable: Enables or disables a workflow definition
workflowconverter: Migrate process definitions to the current CoreMedia CMS version

Analytics tool

dataggregator: Starts, stops, and monitors the Data Aggregator process in a Workflow Server.

User tools

changepassword: Changes the password.
dumpusers: Writes an XML-file containing a representation of the users defined in the internal user administration.
restoreusers: Reads an XML-file containing a representation of the users defined in the internal user administration.

Note that some of the operational tools do not access the CoreMedia CMS server but work on database level. Those tools don't support the standard options because they don't need a user to open a session.
