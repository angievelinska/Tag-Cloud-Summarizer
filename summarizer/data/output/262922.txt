Run-time configuration via context settings

You can enable/disable user feedback features provided by the plug-in (ratings and comments) per site, per channel, and or per article by setting the corresponding contextSettings property in the CMSite, CMChannel, or CMArticle documents.

The default installation enables user feedback features for the ¿Socialize¿ channels of the German and English sites. This is achieved by adding a <StructProperty Name="userFeedback"> element containing a <Struct> with a <BooleanProperty Name="enabled"> to the contextSettings property of the corresponding CMChannel documents. The <BooleanProperty> value may be true or false to activate the user feedback plug-in or disable it, respectively.
