Content management covers creation of content in the repository and analysis of used content. There are basically two ways to populate the content repository:

manual editing
importing external content

Out-of-the-box CoreMedia CMS supports manual creation of content by a variety of clients which are open for customization. In addition, customized clients could be created from the scratch using different frameworks, described in Section.

The CoreMedia Editor, a standalone Java application. Configuration and customization of this editor is covered in the Editor Developer Manual.
The WebEditing Server, a servlet which serves the CoreMedia WebEditor for content editing. The WebEditor offers nearly the same functionality as the CoreMedia Editor but needs less installation.
The WebDAV support, which allows to access the CoreMedia CMS by WebDAV-enabled applications (See the Administration Manual for details.)
The Importer which is used to adopt existing external content, e.g. from legacy systems or content providers. It must be customized concerning the location and the format of the source content. See the Importer Developer Manual for details.

For analysis of the content repository and the acceptance of your websites in the Internet (or Intranet) there is CoreMedia Analytics. It offers a set of predefined detailed reports, the Analytics Dashboard, and easy-to-use reports directly integrated with the preview of your web site, the In-Site Analytics.  You might extend both report types by your own analytics report. See the Analytics Developer Manual for details.
