The third task in the workflow is the 'CheckEmptyChangeSet' task, an If task. The aim of the task is to check if the change set is empty. Then, no publication is necessary and the workflow can be finished. 



Line 1 - 7: An If task is defined with the name 'CheckEmptyChangeSet'. An If task is a control flow element, which will be executed automatically. Thus, no description is necessary, which should be shown in the GUI. 


Line 2 - 4:  A condition is defined that checks, whether the variable "changeSet" contains elements or not.


Line 5:  If the condition evaluates to "true" (change set is empty) the workflow should be finished. Thus the succeeding task is Finish. 


Line 6: If the condition evaluates to "false" (change set contains elements) the changes should be published. Thus, the succeeding task is Publish.
