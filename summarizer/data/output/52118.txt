Large projects with complex settings, many editors, many responsibilites, and deadlines to catch, need some kind of administrative support in order to catch up with all the demands. 


This support is provided by the introduction of the CoreMedia workflows:




Workflows are defined sequences of editorial steps available for defined groups of users acting in certain roles on resources in certain states.


The full editorial routine from creation to publication, from editing to deletion, can be modelled in workflows. These workflows run on a separate CoreMedia component, the Workflow Server.
