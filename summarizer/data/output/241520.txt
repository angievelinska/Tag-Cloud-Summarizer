Example 3 demonstrates how multiple CoreMedia resources can be edited in a single HTML form by implementing an own ActionForm. In this way it is possible to make a (possibly complex) content model totally transparent for the user, as the user doesn't have to know which resource (or resources) he is editing at the moment.

This example shows also how a new CoreMedia resource can be created and linked to another resource automatically, without any interaction from the user.

We'll also examine how the BLOB property of a CoreMedia document can be edited by using the HTML form file upload mechanism.

The configuration section of this chapter also shows how to use the WAGE LoginAction, instead of our own LoginAction from XXX.

As the Action for this example doesn't have to do anything special (only commit the changes made), please refer to the other examples on how to write an appropriate Action class.
