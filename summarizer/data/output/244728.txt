The CoreMedia Starter Kit is based on CoreMedia CMS and therefore supports the same platforms as described in the CoreMedia Administration and Operation Manual. A Starter Kit installation requires some prerequisites before you start the installation. At least you need:

A supported operation system.
A supported Java environment.
A supported database with a supported JDBC driver.

General Prerequisites

General preconditions for starting CoreMedia CMS components:

For operation of CoreMedia CMS on Unix systems, the ksh shell must be installed in /bin . It is used for starting the CoreMedia components on execution of the cm command (see section).
If the CM WebEditor is used an approved browser must be installed.
In general, it must be ensured that all computers in use are mutually visible over DNS.
The image converter service of the server needs the program convert from ImageMagick. On a Linux and Solaris system, you have to use the convert of your distribution. If there is no convert installed, you can download the respective program at ImageMagick. You have to enter the path to the installed convert in the property convertCommand in the file ./properties/corem/imageconverter.properties. If you are using Windows, convert will be installed by the installer program.

Database

The CoreMedia Starter Kit requires a database for operation. The supported databases are described in the "System Requirements" chapter of the CoreMedia Administration and Operation Manual. You need five database users for a complete installation of the Starter Kit:

One user for the Content Management Server database.
One user for the CAE Feeder database of the Content Management environment.
One user for the Analytics database.
One user for the Master Live Server database.
One user for the CAE Feeder database of the Content Delivery environment.

The database must be enabled for the Unicode character set and the database users must be able to create and delete tables and indexes in their schema.

Please also carefully follow the database specific instructions in the CoreMedia Administration and Operation Manual (e.g. schema and user setup).

Search

The Starter Kit does not install a CoreMedia Search Engine. If you want to use full text search in the CoreMedia Editor, WebEditor or on the website you have to install one. Find the installation described in the CoreMedia Administration and Operation Manual. The Starter Kit uses the default ports of the Search Engine (port 13000) and does not use any special index fields. It requires three empty FAST collections:

One for the Content Management Server
One for the Content Application Engine of the Content Management Environment
One for the Content Application Engine of the Content Delivery Environment

For the installation you need the cap-<Vers.No.>.jar file and the license files delivered with CoreMedia CMS.
