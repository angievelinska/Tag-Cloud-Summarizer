A typical HTTP request comprises the following steps:
The request is passed from the servlet container to the Spring dispatcher servlet
The dispatcher servlet dispatches the request to a controller, typically the ContentViewController
The ContentViewController parses the request uri and produces a content id, a view name and possibly other parameters
The ContentViewController maps the content id to a corresponding business object and looks up a cached version, suitable for the desired view
The result is passed to the rendering layer
The ViewDispatcher finds the JSP template corresponding to the bean and invokes it
The JSP evaluates bean properties and includes fragment templates (potentially on associated beans) -> going back to step 6
