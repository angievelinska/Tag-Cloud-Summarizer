CoreMedia systems are distributed systems that have a rather complex structure. This includes databases, hardware, operating systems, drivers, virtual machines, class libraries, customized code etc. in many different combinations. That's why we need detailed information about the environment for a support case. In order to track down your problem, we need:

Which CoreMedia component(s) did the problem occur with (incl. release number)?
Which database is in use (version, drivers)?
Which operating system(s) is/are in use?


Which Java environment is in use?


Which customizations have been implemented?
a full description of the problem (as detailed as possible)
Can the error be reproduced? If yes, give a description please.
How are the security settings (firewall)?

In addition, log files are the most valuable source of information.
