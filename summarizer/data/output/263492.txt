The following process describes the installation of CoreMedia SCI on a Linux or Windows system for test use only (e.g. all components are installed on one computer). For more details refer to the Administration Manual, Chapter 3 instead.

For the installation the CoreMedia installation file cap-<ReleaseNumber>.jar and a license for using the product consisting of license.zip are needed. In addition a database user on an approved database (see section 3.4 in the Administration Manual) is needed.

Install a supported Java Development Kit (JDK).


1#




Move to the directory where the file cap-<ReleaseNumber>.jar is located.


Start the installation with the command java -jar cap-<ReleaseNumber>.jar.



3* A welcome window appears. (Under Linux it might happen that the window is too small to read the content. This is a problem of the JDK. Just resize the window with the mouse, to see the whole content.)

In the next window you can choose your destination directory for the installation. Choose your prefered directory or stick to the default and click [Next].
