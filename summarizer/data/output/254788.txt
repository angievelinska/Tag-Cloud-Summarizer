CoreMedia documents can be exported into XML files in the file system with the cm serverexport utility. These files can be imported again with cm serverimport. The cm serverimport is different to the CoreMedia XML-Importer, which is described in section 5.6.1.

The following limitations for export exist:



Only the latest version of a document is exported.


No metadata, e.g. the last modification date or the status 'published', is exported.


For documents marked for deletion, only name and path are exported.

From the limitations mentioned above the following consequences arise for import:



Only the latest version of a document can be imported.


Documents which were marked for deletion are empty, i.e. all property fields contain null values, such as empty strings, zeros, etc.


Every imported document has the status "checked in" and "not approved".

XML files are created so that internal links to these documents are maintained after import. On import of the complete content of a CoreMedia Server, the content, the folder structure of the documents and the linking of the documents is maintained for documents not marked for deletion.

The properties of the document types on the export server do not have to match those on the import server. Those which are not available on the import server are ignored, and those which exist in addition are filled with null values.

Server Import

The Importer command has the following syntax in CoreMedia SCI:

cm serverimport [ -r | -v | -v2 ] -u user [-d domain] -p password { file | dir }+

The options have the following meaning:
