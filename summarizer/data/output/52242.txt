In CoreMedia CAP 4.0 the public dictionary is located in /home, in CoreMedia SCI 4.1 it will be located in /system. When you update from version 4.0 to 4.1, a new public dictionary will be created in /system and the old dictionary will not be available for the user. So, you have to move the old dictionary to the new location.
