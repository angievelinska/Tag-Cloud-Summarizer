User tasks, automated tasks and control flow tasks have many features in common. They are presented in this section.

The most important common feature of all tasks is that each must be assigned a name, which identifies it uniquely within the process. The name has to be an identifier according to the usual XML rules for names (NMTOKEN).

Since the name is only a symbolic identifier, a task may also contain a description. Although any task may contain a description, it makes most sense for user tasks. If you want to provide localized versions of descriptions, put an identifier instead of the text itself into the description attribute in the workflow definition. In a resource bundle (.properties file, see the editor configuration in the Administrator Manual), you can map the identifier to the localized text, depending on the chosen locale.

Tasks that finish a workflow process are declared final. There has to be at least one task in a process definition, which is declared final. Only user tasks and automated tasks can be declared final.

A task refers its successor by name. Each task must either have at least one successor or be final. Forking tasks may have multiple successors. Joining task may have multiple predecessors.
