If you have made content changes and the PADS has finished, enter the notes into the copy of the PADS schema. Execute the following SQL statements:

UPDATE CacheProperties SET content='<sequenceno>:<idtag>' 
WHERE property='timestamp'

e.g.

UPDATE CacheProperties SET content='201:1426971868' 
WHERE property='timestamp'

This will force the PADS at the productive system to start at the very moment, at which the copy has been made.

Execute the schema migration on the productive system.
To migrate Slave  proceed as described in section.
Connect the copied PADS-database to the migrated Content Servers of the productive system.
Only the changes which appeared after the copy of the PADS database have to be processed. 

Only the builders have changed

If you only have changed the builders, proceed as follows:
Install a parallel running PADS with the changed builders.
If the PADS has finished with building objects, move the database contents of the PADS to the production system.
