For example:

filesystem.export.1.docType=WordFile
filesystem.export.1.property=data
filesystem.export.1.extension.1=.doc
filesystem.export.1.extension.2=.rtf
filesystem.export.1.emptyDocument=/substitute/word
filesystem.export.2.docType=Article
filesystem.export.2.fileType=folder
filesystem.export.2.property.1=text
filesystem.export.2.property.2=image
filesystem.export.2.extension=-Article

The example exports the document types WordFile and Article. Documents of type WordFile are exported as files with the content of the field data. Documents of type Article are exported as folders with two contained files for their fields text and image. When a WebDAV client opens an empty WordFile document, the content of the field data of the document /substitute/word is returned instead. The CoreMedia WebEditing Server creates documents of type WordFile for files with extensions .doc and .rtf and documents of type Article for WebDAV folders with the extension -Article.

Localize Field Names

With the folder mapping fields of documents are mapped to WebDAV files below a folder which represents the document. By default the names of the files are the same as the names of the fields of the document with an additional extension. The names can be localized in the same way as in the CoreMedia Editor. Create additional files for the different locales in the same directory as the file webdav.properties such as webdav_de.properties and webdav_en.properties. Note, that only field localization is used from locale specific configuration files. Localize the file names with properties of the following format: <DocumentType>/<FieldName>Label. Replace <DocumentType> with the document type and <FieldName> with the name of the field.

For example:

Article/textLabel = Description
Article/imageLabel = Picture
