For getting you started CliP comes with an example "Hello World" portlet application. This section shows you how to deploy it in the Starter Kit Integration.

Deployment

After installation of the CoreMedia Lightweight Portal you will find the example helloworld.war file in the folder
<your-starterkit-installation>/management/portlet-example/helloworld/

To deploy it, use the command line deployment tool with the prepare and register commands.

Prepare

In order to adapt the portlet application to the portal, proceed as follows:
In your <your-starterkit-installation>/management/ folder type the following command:

bin/cm deployportlets prepare -i portlet-example/helloworld/helloworld.war
-o jakarta-tomcat/webapps

This command creates the prepared helloworld.war portlet application file in the <your-starterkit-installation>/management/jakarta-tomcat/webapps/ folder.

Register

In order to register the portlet in the content repository proceed as follows:
Make sure that your Content Server is running. 
Type the following command in the <your-starterkit-installation>/management/ folder :

bin/cm deployportlets register
-i jakarta-tomcat/webapps/helloworld.war -u admin -p admin

This command creates a CMPortletDef and a CMPortletInst document at the default location /System/Portlets in the content repository.

For details on the deployment command line tool see Deploying a Portlet Application.

Placing the Portlet on a Website

Now, that you have deployed the "Hello World" portlet, you can place it on a webpage.
Each portlet is visually represented by a portlet window. In the Starter Kit integration, portlet windows are documents of type CMPortletWindow.
To create a CMPortletWindow for your "Hello World" portlet you can just import the predefined content in the portlet-example/helloworld directory. To do so execute the following command from your <your-starterkit-installation>/management/ folder:

bin/cm serverimport -u admin -p admin -r
portlet-example/helloworld/helloworldContent

For detailed instructions on how to position a portlet on a page see Positioning Portlets.

In your CoreMedia Editor you can find the created portlet window in the System/Portlets folder.
