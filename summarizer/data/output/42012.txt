Publication fails

Content-related reasons
3* Broken links or missing folders: The "compose" task is automatically started again, "publish" is kept in display as a reminder. Usually the change set has to be completed.
Technical reasons
3* Publication is stopped and marked erroneous for technical reasons such as Live Server trouble: the publication is paused, not started again and can be continued later by File | Restart menu item or symbol.



Here error messages appear with two possible reasons:

The document linked to has not been published yet. 
The folder where the documents are located has not been published yet.

To correct the error, either add the missing resources to the change set, or remove the broken links.

Copy resources to the change set as described above or from the preview window
Click Links | Complete in the activated detail information window.

to add resources directly from the preview window
Select missing resources in the preview window and choose Edit | Copy from menu bar or context menu.
Switch to the workflow window.
Choose Links | Insert (before) or Insert (after) from menu bar or context menu and do so.
Repeat the publication preview (or the full procedure if necessary)

Delegate task

If you don't like the task or are not permitted to execute it, delegate it:
Switch to the workflow window and insert a comment in the "comment" field if necessary.
Choose File | Delegate from menu or tool bar.
Choose the editor from a list suggested in a dialog box and click [Select].

3* The task disappears from your workflow and is sent to your helper.
