By default, both HTTP port and the CORBA port are bound to all network interfaces. For example your server might be accessible through two network cards using the IP addresses 10.1.3.253 and 10.1.3.254. For security reasons, you might want to grant access to the servers only through one of the interfaces.

To this end, the file contentserver.properties provides the option cap.server.http.bindAllInterfaces. If set to false, only the single interface indicated through cap.server.http.host provides HTTP access.

For limiting the access through CORBA, too, further properties must be set. By setting cap.server.http.host to the correct IP address, you ensure that external clients contact the server through the correct interface. In order to bind only the correct interface, you must set two system properties during the invocation of the server. To this end, add the following lines to your contentserver.jpif or workflowserver.jpif:

JAVA_VM_ARGS="$JAVA_VM_ARGS -Dcom.sun.CORBA.legacy.connection.ORBSocketFactoryClass=com.coremedia.corba.SingleIpSocketFactory50"
JAVA_VM_ARGS="$JAVA_VM_ARGS -Dcom.coremedia.corba.SingleIpSocketFactory.ip=<IpAddress>"

Replace <IpAddress> by the IP address of the network interface to bind, for example 10.1.3.253.
