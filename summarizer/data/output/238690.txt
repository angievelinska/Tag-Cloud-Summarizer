Specify the list of user roles in the property 'requiredRoleCSV', with role names separated by comma. Access is granted to users who assume one or more of the roles specified. Analytics dashboard follows the idea of pluggable authentication providers. If installed against a CoreMedia CMS, the role names will be interpreted as CMS group names.

The following report definition fragment shows an example:

<bean id="ReportDefinition.NewReport" parent="ReportDefinition" >
  ...

  <property name="requiredRoleCSV" 
  value="administratoren,publisher-role"/>

  ...

< /bean>


You have now successfully created a new report definition. Congratulations.
