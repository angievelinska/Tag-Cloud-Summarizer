Various CoreMedia components and utilities as shown in example can be started with the command cm <ComponentName>. The command cm is located in the directory <CoreMediaHome>/bin.

Under Windows an installed component can additionally be started via the entry in the CoreMedia program folder in the Start Menu. Two commands can be used to start a CM component :

The cm command
3*  With this command the program is started and a console window is opened, in which the process output of the Java Virtual Machine can be seen.
The cmw command
3* With cmw, the component is started directly and a console window does not open.

The cm command can use the -nolog option. This option overwrites the OUTPUT_REDIRECT parameter setting of the cm.jpif file with the empty value. Thus all log output is written to standard out.

You will find a description of all server utilities in chapter. Other tools which can be started with cm/cmw can be found all over the manual.
