  /segment/english_tutorial/manage/create.html

The structure behind this example URL is

scheme://domain :port/Web-app context/Spring servlet path
  /segment controller path/navigation path

Considering the website structure, the interesting part of the URL is the navigation path (bold). It starts with the segment of a root navigation and each following segment must be
the segment of a navigation node or leaf node that is a direct child of the current navigation or
the segment of a document that has the current navigation as one of its contexts.

If the last segment leads to a document and not to a navigation node, the extension ".html" is appended.

In the example, there must be a root navigation node with the segment english_tutorial, which has a child navigation node with the segment manage. There must be a document whose contexts contain that child navigation node and whose segment is create. Since the path leads to a document, ".html" is appended. The navigation editor that comes with the Starter Kit WebEditor resembles this structure. The left pane show the navigation tree, while the upper right pane shows all documents that have the selected navigation tree node as one of their contexts. For a user documentation of the navigation editor, see section XXX. If you are a developer and interested in details about how these concepts are reflected in the document type model and APIs, see section.

The idea of a document specifying allowed contexts enables content reuse or content sharing. While navigation nodes (channels) cannot be reused, the Starter Kit allows other documents to specify several contexts in which they can be reused. While each navigation node forms exactly one page, a document forms a page for each of its contexts.
