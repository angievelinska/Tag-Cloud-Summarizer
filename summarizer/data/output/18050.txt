If the database of a Content Server is corrupted, proceed as follows:
Stop the Content Server. The sessions of the connected clients will be closed and no more content changes are possible.
Restore the Content Server with a backup. Note, that this backup must be newer than the backup of the Master Live Server. 
Stop the Master Live Server. Restart the Content Server. Right now, it is possible again to change content, but no new publications are enabled.
Recover the Master Live Server and the Slave Live Servers.

Note that the use of incremental backups is advised in order not to loose any data.
