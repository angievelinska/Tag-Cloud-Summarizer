  Script    Description  

This action executes a shell command and checks whether the programs' return code is "0". If the command returns with a different value an error is assumed. 

Under the Windows operating system you cannot use non-executable commands like dir, copy or echo directly. They will result in a java.io.IOException. The reason is that these commands are part of the Windows command interpreter and not a separate executable. To run these commands use the Windows command interpreter by calling cmd.exe, e.g.: "cmd.exe /C echo test". Attribute
