The CoreMedia Lightweight Portal allows standards-conforming Java Portlets to be integrated into a website generated by the CoreMedia CAE. It gives editorial staff full control over the placement of portlets, while maintaining the flexible page design offered by the CAE.

Portlets enable the CAE to have multiple independently developed, stateful, interactive elements on the same page. In a standard Spring MVC based CAE web site, you can achieve a similar result by implementing multiple controllers and CAE plug-ins, at the price of stronger coupling. Portlet Applications are independently deployed and can use different versions of different third party libraries.

The CoreMedia Lightweight Portal may also come in handy to leverage existing IT investments in portlet technology, or to increase the level of integration with other web applications (e.g. from iframes to true HTML integration).
