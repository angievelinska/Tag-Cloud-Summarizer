The image converter service of the server needs the program convert from ImageMagick. On a Linux and Solaris system, you have to use the convert of your distribution. If there is no convert installed, you can download the respective program at ImageMagick. You have to enter the path to the installed convert in the property convertCommand in the file ./properties/corem/imageconverter.properties. If you are using Windows, convert will be installed by the installer program.

Virtual machine crashes can be experienced when using certain combinations of kernel/glibc under Linux. The crashes were reported to occur mostly on startup. The problems might be fixed by reducing the default stack size. At bash shell, do "ulimit -s 2048"; at tcsh use "limit stacksize 2048". GLIBC 2.2 / Linux 2.4 users should also define an environment variable: "export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5"
