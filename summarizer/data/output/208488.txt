Copy into one cell

If you copy tables or table cells into one table cell, they are inserted as a nested table. All attributes of the inserted table or table cells are conserved. Proceed as follows:
Copy a table or table cells into the clipboard.
Select a cell in the target table.
Paste the data from the clipboard.

An nested table appears in the target table.
