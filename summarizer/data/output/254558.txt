Adjust configurations for database connection in sql.properties. The database for the Workflow Server must be same as for the Content Server. The parameters have the following meaning:

sql.store.driver: This parameter references the JDBC driver of the selected database. The driver is database-specific.
sql.store.url: This parameter gives the URL where the Workflow Server can reach the database.
sql.store.user and sql.store.password: In these parameters, the information about the database user is entered (for more detail see Section 5.1.5).
sql.store.dbProperties: By this parameter, a database-specific configuration file in the directory ./properties/corem is referenced. Configuration files for all supported databases are supplied and contain special information for the particular database. They must not be changed.

Enter the necessary data. If the database is installed on a different computer from the server you have to replace "localhost" with the computer name in sql.store.url. If you are not using an ORACLE database, the other entries also have to be adjusted. Continue with the configuration by clicking on [Next].

In the following dialog you can configure the file capclient.properties.
