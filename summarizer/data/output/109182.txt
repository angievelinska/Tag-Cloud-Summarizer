A JmsUploader sends JMS ObjectMessages to a JMS queue or topic. You may either use a JmsReceiver to read the messages from the queue or topic or write an own JMS client to read and process the messages. For the latter case, the structure of the messages is explained here. A message can be of three different types: update, delete or commit. The message property com_coremedia_generator_pads_uploader_eventtype contains the type as java.lang.String. 


Update messages notify the creation or change of a value. If page generation is used, update messages contain a com.coremedia.generator.Page object as body (see API documentation). Otherwise update messages contain the Java object that was generated by a custom builder. Delete messages are notifications that a value has been deleted. They don't have a body.


Update and delete messages contain the key of the value as java.lang.String in the message property com_coremedia_generator_pads_uploader_eventkey. The key has the format <scheme>:<arguments>. When page generation is used, the arguments are equal to the resource URI of the page.


Commit messages mark a consistent state. They don't have a body or key.
