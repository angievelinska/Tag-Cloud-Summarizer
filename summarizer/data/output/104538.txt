LDAP Enhancement

With CoreMedia SCI 4.2 it is possible to connect one or more LDAP servers to a CoreMedia System and so to streamline user administration. This is possible in Production as well as Live Environments.

The CoreMedia System has reading access to the LDAP server, so changes in CoreMedia's user administration are not transferred to the LDAP server.
