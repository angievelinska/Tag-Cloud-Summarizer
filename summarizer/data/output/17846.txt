If a folder with this name already exists, a new name will be created according to the following scheme:
A counter which counts from 1 to 1000 will be used to attach a unique number to the user name <UserName>_(<No.>).
If 1. fails the time elapsed since 1.1.1970 in ms will be attached to the user name: <UserName>_(<TimeInMs>).
If 1. and 2. fail an error message appears and no folder will be created. This might indicate problems with rights or the network.

You may create your own naming pattern by adding an entry for the property save-user-homeFolderNamePattern to your custom editor bundle. Read the localization chapter of the Editor Developer Manual for more details on own bundles. You can use these variables to create unique names:

{0}: the user name
{1}: a counter which counts from 1 up to 1000 until a unique name is found or the threshold is reached
{2}: the time elapsed since 1.1.1970 in ms

Example:

The editor bundle myBundle.properties contains  the following entry:

save-user-homeFolderNamePattern=UserFolder_{1} 

The User Manager will create home folders UserFolder_1, UserFolder_2 ... UserFolder_1000. If The User Manager is not able to create new folders according to this scheme, the escalation scheme 1. - 3. described above will be used 

Alternatively, you can create a home folder by your own, choosing any desired name. Nevertheless, you should create the folder in the /Home folder.

You can allocate one or more groups to the user determining his rights in the CoreMedia system.

Every user can change his own password later. Furthermore, all users can view the rights structure of the different groups in User Administration but can not change it.

Since the user name is involved in password encryption, it is not possible to change a user name. To do so, you have to create a new user and delete the old one.
