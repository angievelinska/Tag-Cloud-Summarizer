Production Environment

CoreMedia users work on a Content Server from creation to approval of a document. In this, they're supported and guided by the CoreMedia Workflow. A workflow is an automated sequence of editing routines. There are different workflows for different editing routines available. You can also use a full-text search or compare two versions of a document.

Publication transfers your documents and folders to the Master Live Server, and - if implemented - to the Slave Live Servers and creates respectively updates content that now becomes available for other groups of users.

Publication is not just the update of content but makes renaming, moving, or deletion of documents and folders become effective. All modifications of documents or folders can be made effective in the Live Environment only by means of publication. There is no way to perform editorial work in a Live Environment.

Using the CoreMedia Analytics Engine, you can analyze visitor activities on the produced sites or watch reports on the production environment status.
