Performers

Grammar: ANY 

A Performers element specifies external code that is called to determine which users to offer a task for acceptance. If you do not use this element, the default policy DefaultPerformersPolicy is used.

You can either give the fully qualified name of your own Performers class which must be an implementation of com.coremedia.workflow.WfPerformersPolicy, an unqualified classname which will be searched for in the package com.coremedia.workflow.common.policies or have it default to a builtin generic implementation com.coremedia.workflow.common.policies.DefaultPerformersPolicy. 

The default implementation keeps a blacklist of users not permitted to perform a task and a list of preferred users. Upon setting a new preferred user or group the old preference is deleted. For details see the Action class PreferPerformer.
