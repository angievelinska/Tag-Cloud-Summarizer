In CoreMedia CMS it is possible to define multiple document type definitions in separate files (see section). At startup-time the Content Server merges these files to create the complete document type hierarchy. You can use these files to alter an existing document type definition without changing the base definition file in three ways:

Add new document types (see Section).
Inherit from existing document types (see section).
Attach new properties to existing document type definitions.

The first two ways are described in section and section. In this section you will learn how to add properties to an existing document type.

In order to add properties to an existing document type a <DocTypeAspect>-element has been introduced, that allows to attach properties to a document type specified by the  TargetType attribute. There can be many DocTypeAspects attaching properties to the same target DocType, but you have to take care that no property name clashes occur. The relationship between target and aspect is therefore of the cardinality 1:n. As a limitation to ensure consistent behavior in subtypes, it is neither allowed to alter existing or inherited properties nor attach properties that are already defined in subtypes of the TargetType. To define DocTypeAspects the definition file must be valid against the coremedia-doctypes-2008.xsd schema.
