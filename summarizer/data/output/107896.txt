Builders implement the interface com.coremedia.generator.Builder. See the Javadoc API documentation for further details. 

A builder is invoked to compute a value for a given key. All values must be serializable, because they are stored in the persistent cache. During the computation of a value a builder can read fragment values and link to top-level values. A builder can't read top-level values and it can't link to fragment values. 

You can invalidate all values computed by a certain builder using the development pages. This may be needed if you change the builder implementation or configuration. 

Create key to read a fragment or link to a top-level value. 

For both reading a value and linking to one you need the key of that value. The simplest way would be to create its string representation in the calling builder. That is, if you want to read a fragment value, you could use something like:
