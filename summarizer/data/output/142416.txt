Example

In order to remove all documents from the recycle bin that are not referenced by any other document outside the recycle bin and have a modification date that is less than or equal to 2001-12-31 call:

cm cleanrecyclebin --simulate --before 20011231000000

Performance

On systems with many documents in the recycle bin  the collection process might take a while to run it's mark and sweep phase. If the process seems to do nothing (i.e. generates no log output) don't kill it. This phase might take an hour or more.
