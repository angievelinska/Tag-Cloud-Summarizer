A CoreMedia System is made of two environments: a Production Environment and one or more Live Environments; depending on if the Multi-Site Extension has been installed or not. 

Production is the creation, modification, deletion, and editing of texts, images, multimedia file, or the (mostly automated) import of content.

After production, the edited content is 'moved' to the Live Environment by a publication, i.e. the database content in the Live Environment is updated and made available for a different group of users.

The illustration outlines the basic architecture of such a CoreMedia System - but the technical base allows much more complex scenarios.
