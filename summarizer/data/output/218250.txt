A CoreMedia system has to rely on several different (3rd party) software components, for proper operation. CoreMedia tests CoreMediaCMS2005  with the most common combinations used by our customers and distinguishes between two levels of approved infrastructure components:

Certified level
Certified infrastructure components are extensively tested to work with the CoreMedia SCI system. Every infrastructure component approved with the first final CMS Release is certified.  It is recommended to use these components for productive systems.
Supported level


Supported infrastructure components will also work with CoreMedia components but they are tested less exhaustively, because they are released after the first final CMS Release. They also can be used for productive systems. Refer to the notes.html file for announcements of additionally-supported environments or the appendix of this manual.



Note: the state "deprecated" is also used on occasion. Deprecated infrastructure components are either of certified or supported level in the current version of the CoreMedia CMS but do not carry official approval by CoreMedia beyond this version.
