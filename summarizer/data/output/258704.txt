The Analytics Dashboard provides access to reports in different MIME types. Currently, these are HTML (used by the Analytics Dashboard application), PDF, Microsoft Excel and a generic XML report data export format.

While reports are accessible via the HTML interface, the Dashboard Application additionally provides direct report access via REST-conform URLs. Direct Report Access aims at providing access to reports in different MIME types with a customized parameter sets (report variable settings). A REST-based service interface has been chosen to allow humans as well as services to access reports. 

Envisioned use case are: Human users may directly access HTML, PDF or Excel reports with a given parameter set (pre-selected site, time range, etc.), services may fetch XML data (for analytics data integration, visualization or post-processing) or PDF and Excel documents (example: automated email newsletter service).

The same security measures as for the Web-based report access applies to direct report access. Any access to reports need to be authenticated (in case authentication is configured). Automated services will typically use HTTP basic authentication to retrieve XML, PDF or Excel data. If necessary, the transport can be secured by means of HTTPS.

Any client accessing reports via the Direct Report Access interface is mapped to a dashboard user profile (see the section above on profiles and views). Hence, clients can only access reports which are accessible via the Dashboard user interface as well. Direct Report Access is thus not to be compared with direct Analytics Database access, since the latter is per se not enforcing role-based data filtering.

Report Identification: Naming scheme

Reports are identified by a combination of view name and view-specific report identifier. You find the names in the file analytics-profiles-and-views.xml. Report view names are unique per dashboard configuration, and a view may be included in more than one user profile. The view name is not user profile-specific. The report identifier is view-specific, hence it identifies a (potentially generic) report definition customized for the given view.

Example: the report identifier '/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView.performance' will be mapped to the view named 'DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView' and the report identified as 'DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView.performance' within that specific view.

Implications: 

As user profiles are not used for report identification, all user profiles containing the given view may access the view and its reports.
Views typically define customized reports, e.g. reports which are restricted to a single site or which have fixed, predefined report parameters. These restrictions/customizations of course apply to the direct report access.

Direct Report Access URL format

Reports are accessed using HTTP GET requests. Per default configuration, the direct report access base URL is

http://<server>:<port>/analytics/dashboard/report/<viewname>/<reportidentifier>

followed by further parameters, e.g. MIME-type parameters, report variable values, which will be explained later.

The URL follows a segment scheme:

single segments for (predefined) identifiers view name and report identifier (examples: '/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView.performance/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView.performance') and
double segments to denote non-predefined parameters ('/<name>/<value>'). Report variable names must be prepended with a dot ('.') (example: '/.timeRange/r1m'), while control, formatting and layout parameters have no dot prepended. (example: '/format/xml').

The order of the direct report identifiers view name and report identifier is fixed, while all other parameters (name / value pairs) may technically be specified in any order. In canonical form control, formatting and layout parameters go first (with parameter names given in alphabetical name order), followed by the report variables (again with variable names in alphabetical order).

Example URL:
http://<server>:<port>/analytics/dashboard/report/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView/DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView.performance/format/xml/.timeRange/r1m

This URL points to the report identified by view 'DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView' and report identifier 'DashboardViewDefinition.defaultView.performance', rendered in xml and configured to show the recent 1 month (symbolic value 'r1m').

Please note that clients must be able to handle HTTP redirects.
