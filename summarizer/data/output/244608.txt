Developing templates which use fragments is very similar to the development of plain CAE templates. You have a tag-library which you use to include fragments in your template. Instead of <cm:include self="bean" view="view"> you have to use <httpcache:include target="bean" view="view">.

The tag-library exists in JSP-1.2 and JSP-2.0 variants, which are equal in usage and function. Include it into your template using:

JSP 1.2

<%@ taglib prefix="httpcache" 
uri="http://www.coremedia.com/2007/httpcache-1.0-1.2" %> 

JSP 2.0

<%@ taglib prefix="httpcache" 
uri="http://www.coremedia.com/2007/httpcache-1.0-2.0" %> 

Following tags exist:
