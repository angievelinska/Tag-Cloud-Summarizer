URL in format

http://< MasterLiveServerComputerName>:<port>/coremedia/ior  Sets the location where the Replicator can find the IOR of the Master Live Server. replicator.{user,domain,password} String  Configures the user name, domain and password to authenticate against the Master Live Server. replicator.chunkingThreshold int 0 Sets the maximum number of events that is fetched from the Master Live Server in one chunk during startup; 0 indicates no limit. Lowering the threshold will reduce main memory consumption at the cost of startup times. replicator.Packager.flushSize int 1000 Sets the maximum number of events that the packager holds in main memory before flushing to disk. Lowering the flush size will reduce main memory consumption at the cost of write performance. 

replicator.{IncomingCounter,Preparer,PrepareLogger,Packager,PackageLogger,Executor,ExecutionLogger,CompletedCounter}.channelSize

 int 0 Sets the channel sizes for the event pipeline before the given stage; 0 indicates unlimited queues. Lowering the queue sizes will reduce main memory consumption at the cost of write performance. replicator.startupTimeout true/false false Defines if the Replication Live Server waits on start for the Replicator to connect to the Master Live Server (true). replicator.enable true/false true Defines if the Replicator should be started on start of the Replication Live Server (true). replicator.preventOnlineSwitch true/false false If set "true" the Replication Live Server will replicate the content but will not switched online afterwards. replicator.maxAcceptedLag int 100 The Replication Live Server is offline after a consistent replication but it is more than the given number of events behind the current timestamp, then the Replication Live Server will  not go online until it catches up. replicator.restartReplicatorOnError true/false true Restart the Replicator if an error occurs on Replication Live Server side (true). Otherwise the Replicator will be stopped. replicator.shutdownServerOnError true/false false Stop the Replication Live Server if an error occurs on Replication Live Server side replicator.logEvents true/false false All repository events will be logged (true). replicator.autoRestart true/false true Restarts the Replicator sessions if lost (true). replicator.checkStream true/false true Defines if the Replication Live Server checks the event queue for connection (true). replicator.checkTimeout int 300 The time in seconds after which the Replication Live Server checks the event queue for connection.
