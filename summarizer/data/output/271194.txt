This section describes how the CoreMedia Lightweight Portal handles exceptions thrown by or during the invocation of portlets and your options to customize the error handling.

In general, the Portal continues request processing and invokes further required portlets after catching exceptions for a single portlet window. Exceptions for portlet windows can be handled with dedicated error views without affecting other parts of the rendered page. Requests for portlet resources are different as the whole response is coming from a single portlet. An exception in a portlet resource request breaks the whole request and will be propagated to the servlet container which might render an error page if configured.

Error view

If a portlet render or portlet action request threw an exception, the portlet tag cannot render the content of the affected portlet window but will include an error view instead. It uses the Content Application Engine's include mechanism to render a fragment for the thrown exception. Exceptions for portlet windows are represented by instances of class PortletWindowException. A PortletWindowException provides methods to get the affected portlet window, error code, error message and exception cause.

For example, if a PortletWindowException was raised for the portlet window self the following JSP tag will try to include the PortletWindowException object with view errorMessage:
