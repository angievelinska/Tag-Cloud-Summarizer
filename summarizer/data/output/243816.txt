InitialAssignment



Grammar: ( (Reads | Writes)*, Validator) 

An InitialAssignment element defines that a variable is 'important' to a process instance during the initial creation of the workflow before the workflow is started. This way it is possible to set initial arguments for a process instance which cannot be changed after the instance is started. 

With Reads and Writes the variables are specified.  The variables can or have to be modified by a user or an external process. Thus the InitialAssignment element defines a view on the variables. The modifications of the variables may be validated by Validators.
