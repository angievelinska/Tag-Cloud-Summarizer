Actions are used to automate or semi-automate tasks. To do so, arbitrary actions can be invoked at the start or end of a user task or during an automated task:

User Task



Element <EntryAction>


3* This kind of action is invoked after the task is accepted, but before the user starts to work on the task. Typical start actions are the initialization of resources.


Element <ExitAction>


3* These actions are invoked after the task has been completed by the user and after the postconditions are checked, but before the workflow continues. A typical exit action might complete the users work and set some calculated properties, approve resources in the name of a user, show up a publication window etc.

Automated Task



Element <Action>


3* An automated task is not performed by a user. The task duration is exactly the duration of the invoked actions plus pre- and conditions. If pre- or postconditions are violated, the task is aborted. 

All actions except for actions in automated tasks are executed with the rights and on behalf of the user who accepted the task. Actions in automated tasks run with the workflow servers "user" account at the Content Management Server.
