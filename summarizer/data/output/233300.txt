 Pre-Aggregated and Pre-Consolidated Data

The term 'pre-aggregated data' refers to the fact that the data has been pre-aggregated following the CoreMedia Analytics Database schema for given time intervals, mainly for performance reason.

The term 'pre-consolidation of data' refers to the fact that the queried data is and should be consolidated by the Analytics Database only. Pre-consolidated data is in fact pre-aggregated but additionally data has been consolidated in order to identify the most relevant part of it (e.g. the Top N of all viewed pages). The data definitely should NOT be consolidated by a subsequent report query consolidator, mainly for performance implications and/or excessive memory consumption during consolidation. An example for a pre-consolidated data category report is the 'Top 10 Viewed Pages' report: Consolidation of query data of more than one time interval would cause high memory usage as data for all pages would have to be loaded in order to aggregate them. The Analytics Database does pre-consolidate data for this type of category reports.

Querying non-aggregated / non-consolidated data

Queries that execute on non-aggregated relational data should use the SimpleCategoryQuery, or the SimpleTimeSeriesQuery respectively. These types of queries do not take the Analytics Database time model into account. They offer plain SQL query functionality. Please note that for the rest of this section, the examples shown will use pre-aggregated and pre-consolidated queries, not Simple Queries.
