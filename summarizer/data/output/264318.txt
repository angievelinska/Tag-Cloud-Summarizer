Caching is conceptually separated from the business objects. The business objects are beans for contents in the repository and should not contain any additional fields - they are designed to simply provide read- and write-through access to their content objects in the database. Caching is configured in a declarative manner without direct modifications to the business objects. You can define properties on individual content beans that are to be cached, as well as aggregations and other forms of associations with other business objects. These caching definitions are coined data views. From this declaration, the CoreMedia Content Application Engine will generate classes that are equivalent to your business objects but additionally have cached state. The generation process is almost transparent and the generated classes comply with the same public interface(s) as your original classes.
