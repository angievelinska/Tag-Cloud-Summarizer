The administration page shows the current status, statistic information and configuration of the Search Engine Feeder. At the top of the page is a link to start or stop the Search Engine Feeder.

Furthermore there is a link to show error documents. They represent documents that were not processed successfully by the Search Engine Feeder or the CoreMedia Search Engine. The page contains links to manually retry indexing of error documents. If not used, the Search Engine Feeder retries indexing of error documents the next time the document changes.

Error documents can also be found with a FAST query for all documents with the value ERROR in the index field feederstate. The field feederinfo contains an error description.
