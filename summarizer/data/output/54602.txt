Error behavior 

Transactions which are active at the time of failure or which first notice the failure are terminated with an error. The error is passed to the server and clients. Further publications lead to errors. The Slave Live Servers detect the malfuntion and attempt to reconnect. You can see the login attempts in the server log. Transactions started after the server has detected the database failure are blocked until a new database connection is created. Clients (replication of the Live Server, publication, etc.) remain paused. Appropriate messages are written to the server log. 

Error correction 

As soon as the database is available again the server creates new connections to the database (watch the server log) and blocked transactions are released. Note: Error-free operation after a database breakdown cannot be guaranteed, since external components are also affected (e.g. JDBC driver). If an error occurs here, it is usually recognized by the watchdog and remedied  by restarting the server.
