If all documents in your document list have either been skipped or processed, the Search-and-Replace  Workflow is finished.

CoreMedia SCI applications with freely configurable workflows allow to integrate an automatic publication workflow right after finishing the global search and replace.

In any case processed documents have to be published in order to make the changes effective.

You may collect these documents via the menu item Navigation| To be published.
