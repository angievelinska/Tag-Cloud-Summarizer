If you want to deploy the WebEditor into the WebSphere Application Server you need to configure the web application and create the war-file.

Configure the WebEditor web application as decribed in chapter. For the use with the WebSphere Application Server you need to add the following line to the editor/WEB-INF/config.bsh file:

generator.setBackdoorConnector(new hox.corem.generatorv3.AlternateServlet23BackdoorConnector());

Now, you can create the war-file as follows:
Install the WebEditor without the Tomcat servlet container (see chapter).
Switch to the directory of the WebEditor: cd <CoreMediaHome>/webapps/editor
Create the war-file: jar cvf editor.war
