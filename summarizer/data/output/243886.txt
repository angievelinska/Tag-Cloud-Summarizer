Variable

Grammar: (Value)? 

Variables carry state for the workflow process. It may be modified from within the workflow engine or by changing client view variables.

A variable is referenced by its name. It has a type which is determined by the Value class given with the type attribute. See Value for details. The value of a variable is defined by one of the elements Boolean, String etc. 

If a variable is declared as readOnly and the process instance has been started, it is not possible to modify it. If a variable is declared as static, it maintains its state, otherwise it is re-initialized to the defined default every time a task instance is started.
