User and Groups

In order to perform tasks within the predefined workflows, users have to be assigned to special role groups (in addition to their project-specific group memberships):


composer-role: to be able to create (and start) a workflow


approver-role:to be able to approve resources within a workflow


publisher-role: to be able to publish resources

These role groups (see also this article) are predefined, membership is granted by the CoreMedia administrator. 

In CoreMedia SCI role groups and normal groups can be merged together. I.e. you wouldn't see the role groups in the user management window. Instead, the role groups would be assigned to normal groups via a configuration file (see the Administration Manual for details).
