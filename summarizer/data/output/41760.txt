In CoreMedia SCI there are two user-defined dictionaries: 



a central dictionary for your CoreMedia SCI installation located as document type 'dictionary' in the folder 'system'. 


a personal user-defined dictionary of the document type 'dictionary'  for every CM SCI user, located in the user's folder.



Add a word formerly unknown by clicking [Add] in the spell checker.
