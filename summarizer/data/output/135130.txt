It is not possible to attach a contextinfo tag to the <body> element of a webpage. If you need a top level contextinfo for the whole page you can surround the inner tags of the <body> tag by a contextinfo tag, e.g. 

<body>
  <pbe:adscontextinfo ...>
   inner tags ...
  </pbe:adscontextinfo>
</body>

Although it is encouraged to use the contextinfo tag in cached fragments, the template developer should be aware, that usage of the tag in cached fragments is only allowed, if the fragment always relates to the same resources (which should normally be the case). Otherwise a context menu may direct to the wrong repository resources.
