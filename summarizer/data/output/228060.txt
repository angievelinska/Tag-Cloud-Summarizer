The CAE Feeder template is based on the Proactive Engine to proactively feed content beans. The following components connect the Proactive Engine:

The FeedableContentBeanEvaluator creates Feedables from content beans. It defines which and how properties of content beans are indexed.
The FeedingReceiver passes Feedables and document identifiers to the CAE Feeder in order to add, update and remove documents in the index. 

Follow these steps to customize the CAE Feeder for your application:
Specify the set of indexed content beans
Configure content bean classes
Customize Feedables
