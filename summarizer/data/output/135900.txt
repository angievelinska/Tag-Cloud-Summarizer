 Attribute Value Default Description user user name none (required attribute) The user account the Search Engine Feeder uses to read content. password password none (required attribute) The password for the user account of the Search Engine Feeder. restartAfterError true or false true true if the Search Engine Feeder restarts automatically after errors from the Search Engine. false otherwise. restartAfterErrorDelay time in seconds 60 The time in seconds to wait before trying to restart the Search Engine Feeder if restartAfterError is true. documentDelay time in seconds 10 The maximum time in seconds between adding a document to a batch and sending that batch to the CoreMedia Search Engine. retryDocumentDelay time in seconds 30 The maximum time in seconds between adding a retried document to a batch and sending that batch to the CoreMedia Search Engine. This can happen after batch failures caused by temporary problems in the CoreMedia Search Engine such as high load. errorDocumentDelay time in seconds 60 The maximum time in seconds between adding an error document to a batch and sending that batch to the CoreMedia Search Engine. Error documents serve as placeholders for documents that could not be processed. timestampDelay time in seconds 60 The maximum time in seconds between adding a timestamp to a batch and sending that batch to the CoreMedia Search Engine. indexDeletedResources true or false true true if documents in the trash should be indexed. If you do not need to find documents in the trash and want to keep your index smaller, you can change this to false. indexGroups true or false true true to index the groups with potential read rights with the document in the index field groups. This set of groups is then used to narrow a user's search to the documents where he might have read rights to. This is just an optimization to get smaller search results for some queries and content structures. The client has to check for read rights anyway.. You may want to set this to false to avoid updating the index for all documents below a certain folder if the right rules of the folder change.
