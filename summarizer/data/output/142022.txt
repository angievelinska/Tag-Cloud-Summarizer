 Problem Check I enabled PBE, but no context menu appears. 

Does the generated HTML source contain javascript elements where you placed the <contextinfo/> tag? The javascript always begins with if (typeof(com)!='undefined') { new com.coremedia.easyedit.ContextInfo ...
Does the generated HTML source contain <script src="/coremedia/pbe/cap-pbe.js" language="JavaScript"></script> The generated HTML source does not contain <script src="/coremedia/pbe/cap-pbe.js" language="JavaScript"></script> 

You forgot to place the <pbe:head/> in the jsp rendering your header. The java script is generated, but still no context menu appears. 

You may have forgotten to add the event attribute to your <contextinfo/> tag.
You may have forgotten to adapt the config.bsh settings of Preview-based Editing to your webapp. The context menu appears, but there is no hover effect. 

You may have forgotten to provide a css style sheet for the hover effect. The WebEditor does not open when using the contextmenu from a remote computer. 

You probably used localhost for the webEditorUri in config.bsh. Replace it with the name under which the computer is known in the network. The hover effect affects other elements, too. 

The HTML elements that are surrounded by <contextinfo/> are probably not valid. Check the source and correct the errors.
