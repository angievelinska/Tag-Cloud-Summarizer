You can control the CoreMedia Watchdog using the cm tool with the options <start|stop|kill|term|run|restart|status>. Please read section for a description of all options.

Watchdog

You have to differentiate between a Windows and a UNIX environment. In both cases, the component arguments (the components to be watched) in the command must be defined in the configuration file watchdog.xml (see section).

Windows environment

If you have installed the Watchdog as a Windows service (see section), proceed as follows:
Add the components to watch to the JAVA_MAIN_ARGS property in the <CoreMediaHome>/bin/watchdog.jpif file.

E.g. JAVA_VM_ARGS="-watch WatchContentServer WatchGenerator
2#
Start the Watchdog with cm watchdog start.

Stop the Watchdog simply with cm watchdog stop.

UNIX environment

If you want to run the Watchdog in a UNIX environment you can either enter the components to watch as described for the Windows environment or proceed as follows:
Start the Watchdog with:

 cm watchdog start <ComponentToWatch> ...

Probedog

For the Probedog mode you don't have to differentiate between Windows and UNIX environment. Execute the Probedog with:
cm probedog <component>
