Question: 

How can I access arbitrary resources? 

Answer: 
Get the root folder of the repository: 

FolderModel rootFolder=Editor.getEditor().getResourceFactory.getRootFolder(); 
This returns a FolderModel which can be used for further processing. 
2#
Get the resource you are looking for: 



ResourceModel myResource=rootFolder.pathLookup(new String []({"myFolderName", "myDocumentName"})); 

or 

ResourceModel myResource=rootFolder.pathLookup(new String("myFolderName/myDocumentName")); 
This will return a ResourceModel of the searched resource or null if the resource does not exists.
