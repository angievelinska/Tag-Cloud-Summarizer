Wrap-Up


In a nutshell, a thin template marked as non-cacheable branches, depending on the request, to one or more content templates marked as cacheable. The actual work is carried out in the content template. In comparison to a page generated completely dynamic, the calculation work per request is reduced to the absolute minimum in this way. The general procedure can be summarized as follows:


Collect the necessary dynamic state in a dispatch template marked as non-cacheable

Encode the state into the parameters of a ResourceUri

Branch to the page identified by this URI, which is then created by a template marked as cacheable.


You should make sure that not too many parameter combinations are created and that only parameters which actually have an influence on the output are passed to a template. For example, it doesn't make sense to transfer a session ID in this form. Otherwise, too many variants of the page are stored in the cache memory and in this way diminish the effectivity of the cache.


You can proceed in a similar way with fragments: for example, a dynamically generated homepage could select several pre-calculated fragments and insert them in varying order. When all dynamic decisions are made in the template of the homepage, the fragments can be delivered rapidly from the cache.
