The CoreMedia Editor and the CoreMedia WebEditor integrate a fast full-text search for documents. This search is limited to the last document version. In order to search for previous document versions you need to use the Query.

The full-text search does not only find documents with the key words in simple text fields but also in specific BLOB fields. These may contain Microsoft Word documents or PDF documents.

For the easiest search the editor simply enters a keyword into the search field and starts the search. The CoreMedia Editor shows the result documents which contain the keyword and for which the editor has read rights. The editor can select documents from the result list for further editing.

The full-text search returns a result very fast. Nevertheless, you should try to create the search in such a way, that the result set remains small. The editor needs more memory and time to view large result sets and its hard to work with large result sets. Therefore, the CoreMedia Content Management Server limits the size of the result set (up to now to 4000 documents). This intends, that you will not always see the whole result set in the editor.

The CoreMedia Editor integrates the full-text search into the Explorer window and into the file chooser dialog. The following subchapters describe the search in these windows of the CoreMedia Editor. In the CoreMedia WebEditor you cannot search in the file chooser dialog, in addition there is no distinct search view in which to refine the search.

Not all character combinations are allowed search terms and some characters have a special meaning. The last chapter defines allowed search terms and describes special characters.
