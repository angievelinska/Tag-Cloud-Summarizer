CoreMedia CMS allows you to define a custom model of your website structure and URL format. While this is very flexible, the Starter Kit provides an out-of-the-box solution for website structure, navigation and URLs that fulfills typical requirements.

A concrete structure model is needed to provide the following basic website features:

Navigation, e.g. by menu or expanding navigation tree.
Breadcrumb, telling you where in the website you are.
Sitemap, giving an overview of the overall site structure.
Search engine friendly and readable URLs, reflecting the document's path and breadcrumb.

The website structure is usually regarded to consist of hierarchical pages, where each page has an URL and each URL leads to a page. The relevant part of the URL for the website structure is the URL path. It is composed of slash-separated segments, which fits the fact that pages are hierarchical.
