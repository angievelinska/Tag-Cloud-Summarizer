Q: I wrote a model bean that I have put into the pageflow. When I'm accessing a JSP that uses it only half of the page is rendered. The html output is broken. What went wrong?
A: ES uses the JSF client-side state saving method by default. This implies, that pageflow scoped beans will be serialized to the response stream. If a NotSerializableException is thrown JSF behaves as you observed.


Q: I've written a JSP that renders a form including several input fields and a button. Nothing happens when I'm pressing the button. What's wrong?
A: Either the JS-lib could not be loaded or your browser disabled JavaScript.


Q: I've written a JSP that renders a form including several input fields and buttons. When I'm pressing the button, the form is submitted but the button's action is not executed. What's wrong?
A: If you are using a command button that renders a submit control like <input type="submit"> it can be the same as in question 2. If not, the most likely cause is that a validation or conversion error occurs on the server-side. Try <h:messages> in your JSP to output possible error messages.
