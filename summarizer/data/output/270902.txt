You configure a portlet application using two documents in the content repository. 

CMPortletDef
CMPortletInst

Both documents are generated automatically during portlet deployment (see portlet deployment).

CMPortletDef

The document type CMPortletDef represents a portlet definition in the content repository. It currently consists of the application name and the portlet name, and additional information extracted from the portlet.xml.

applicationName: corresponds to the name of the portlet's war file. It represents a portlet application which can contain multiple portlets.
portletName: is taken from <portlet-name>-tag in the portlet.xml. It identifies a portlet within a portlet application.
defaultPreferences: contains a copy of the <portlet-preferences>-tag in the portlet.xml. The default preferences are used only when a portlet instance wants to reset a preference to its default value.
portletSupports: contains a copy of the <supports>-tag in the portlet.xml.


title, shortTitle: is taken from the <title> and <short-title> elements in the portlet.xml.



CMPortletInst

The document type CMPortletInst represents a portlet instance in the content repository. A portlet instance provides one configuration of a portlet with preferences. There may be multiple portlet instances per portlet definition. The portlet instance currently consists of a link property referring to the CMPortletDef document and a markup property storing the portlet preferences.

portletDefinition: contains a link to the CMPortletDef document.
preferences: is originally taken from <portlet-preferences>-tag in the portlet.xml. It defines the preferences accessible to the portlet using the javax.portlet.PortletPreferences interface.

Additional instances can be created by copying and modifying the document. For further details, read on in Configuring Portlet Preferences.
