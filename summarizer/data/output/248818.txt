The JSP technology used by the ADS allows to insert the contents of other pages into the ouput of a page. For this purpose there is the jsp:include tag. You can use this tag when similar fragments occur in many templates - by storing the appropriate code and static HTML text. You only need to apply later changes and improvements at one place.


Furthermore, when inserting pages created by the CoreMedia Active Delivery Server, you benefit from the cache of the ADS. This aspect is explained in detail in Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.5.3.


Often, it is desired to output the contents of other CoreMedia resources in another enclosing page, e.g. in connection with a LinkListProperty (Section 4.2.2.6) or the documents of a folder (Section 4.2.3). For this purpose, the URI of the document is obtained and passed as an attribute of the JSP tag.
