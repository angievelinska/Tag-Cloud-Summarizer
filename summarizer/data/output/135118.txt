For the Active Delivery Server there is already a predefined defaultUri="/,templateId=menu". You may naturally override this defaultUri in your config.bsh.

CoreMedia Editor via Remote Control

It is possible to use the CoreMedia Editor via Remote Control instead of the WebEditor. Besides the configuration of the remoteControlUri you have to adapt Resource/menu.jsp. Just change the four commands at the end of the file named "open-documentview", "open-document", "open-container" and "open-info" into "open-documentview-remote", "open-document-remote", "open-container-remote" and "open-info-remote".
