The time interval parameter allows a user to choose the time interval. The parameter selection box offers two alternative ways

Relative time intervals, which express intervals relative to 'now'. Examples are 'last 12 months' and 'last week'. Relative time intervals are values always available in the selection box and so far, the available values do not change dynamically.


Absolute time intervals. Examples are 'Q2 2006', 'August 2006' or '31st of December 2006'. When selecting an absolute time interval, the values available in the selection box change accordingly. An up arrow identifies absolute values of broader time intervals, while down arrows indicate finer time intervals contained within the currently selected one. Example: When the absolute time interval 3rd Quarter 2006 is selected, the broader time interval "2nd half year of 2006" and finer time intervals July, August and September 2006 are given as selectable choices. Hint: You may need to move up to broader time intervals before you can select time intervals that are earlier or later than the currently selected.

Absolute time intervals shown in red denote intervals that are not yet completed (the end lies after the current point in time). No data will be reported for these intervals, still they can be useful to drill-down to finer-grained time intervals which are completed yet. Example: In February 2007 the time interval 'Q1 2007' is not completed yet, still it serves to drill down to 'Jan 2007', which is already finished.
