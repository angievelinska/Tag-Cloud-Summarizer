The watchdog is configured with two files:

watchdog.properties 
watchdog.xml. 

The name of the XML file is defined in watchdog.properties. watchdog.xml is the default value. The default location of the watchdog.properties file is corem/watchdog.properties. You can customize this location using the system property coremedia.watchdog.propertiesfile in the watchdog.jpif of probedog.jpif file:

JAVA_VM_ARGS="$JAVA_VM_ARGS -Dcoremedia.watchdog.propertiesfile=
corem/watchdog.properties"
