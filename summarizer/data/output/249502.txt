Typically, you would define profiles for user groups using Analytics, e.g.:

a controller profile with views showing the overall and per-site performance, top search terms on Search Engines like Google, MSN Live, etc.,
a profile for editors with page views, exit pages, content repository information and
an administrator profile showing page views, content repository information and later browser types.

The profile views would customize generic report definitions, e.g. change report titles and explanations to the user group's need.

See #customization# on how to define profiles and views.
