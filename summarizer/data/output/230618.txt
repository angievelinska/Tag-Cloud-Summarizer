In JSF actions and navigation are closely related. The value of the action  attribute must be a MethodBinding that evaluates to a method returning a string. This String will be passed to the JSF navigation handler.  Editing Services for JSF supports this by defining navigation handlers that can be attached to actions. If the execution of an action succeeds the navigation handler will be invoked. This behavior implies that using the <es:button>-tag allows to invoke navigation handlers using the button's value, action and actionListener  attributes. The value, actionListener and action attributes will be evaluated in this order. Note that all actions or action listeners defined by these attributes will be executed but only the first navigation handler actually handles the navigation.
