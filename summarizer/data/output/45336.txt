The template for Picture uses the small.jsp template of property type image, as can be see in the codeline

Uri imgInclude = document.getPropertyUri("Image","small"); 

The following line includes the output of small.jsp directly in the HTML-page that is eventually generated:

context.include(pageContext, imgInclude); 

Now you can have a look at one of the Pictures. To accomplish this enter the following URL in the browser, where SpicyTrout_pic is the name of the Picture residing in the Fish folder:

http://localhost:8001/coremedia/generator/MenuSite/Fish/SpicyTrout_pic,templateId=render.html

The browser displays the Picture using the Picture template render.jsp! 

Now change the line in Picture/render.jsp where imgInclude is set to

Uri imgInclude = document.getPropertyUri("image","large"); 

If the picture is reloaded in the browser with the same URL the picture comes up large.
