Documents within the editing lifecycle can go through different states. In this, there is a difference between document states and document version states.

The state of a document version is related to just this version of the document and its editorial state, whereas the document state labels the state of the document concerning its publication.

The first paragraph names the states of document versions, the second paragraph surveys document states.
