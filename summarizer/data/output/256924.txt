Deleted documents were moved into the recycle bin.

The differences in handling the recycle bin from handling the Windows recycle bins are:

There is a recycle bin only on the Content Management Server. In order to delete files, start your CoreMedia Editor, select and delete them (e.g. via File|Delete). Publish these resources (e.g. via File|Publish). If they had been on the Master Live Server before, they are now deleted there.
Furthermore, you cannot directly access deleted files. In order to retrieve a document you have to perform a query and copy the document from the query window into the target folder or restore them. How to perform a a query, learn in section.
In contrast to Windows recycle bins, you can't restore folders with content. If you restore a folder from the recycle bin, only the folder but no contained documents will be restored. On the other hand, if you restore a document, whose folders has also been moved to trash, this folder will also be restored.
