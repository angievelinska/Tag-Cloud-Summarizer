A web extension is an addition to the CoreMedia Editor and the CoreMedia WebEditor. A web extension is part of a standard web application in a servlet container. It displays one or more web pages and might return a result back to the invoking editor by starting a web request the editor can handle. In case of the CoreMedia Editor the web extension can open a URL to the editor¿s remote control with the result of the web extension call as an URL parameter.

CoreMedia CMS contains three web extensions:

Preview - Shows a preview of the selected document with different web browsers and different render URLs
Extended Query - A web GUI for building a query that contains "and", "or" and "not" operators and which is more powerful than the already existing query builder in the Query Window.
Bean Query - A web GUI for building queries for Content Rules.
Differencing - Shows two versions of a document, with highlighted differences.

<WebContext>

Child elements: <WebExtensions>

Parent element: <Editor>



<Editor>
  ..
    <WebContext host="webExtHost" port="8001" 
    context="editor-extensions" 
    loginPort="8443">
      ...
    </WebContext>
  ...
</Editor>



The <WebContext> element configures a web application in a Servlet container. Therefore this element defines connection parameters. It is a container for <WebExtension> elements.
