The diagram follows a tabular structure: 

The leftmost column displays the page rank. Pages with an identical number of requests will display the same rank. 
The name column shows the page display name or, if no display name is available, the page technical id.
To the right of the name column the number of total absolute requests of the object is shown. Additionally, this number is visualized with a horizontal bar displayed behind the name column.
The rightmost column indicates the relative proportion of all page requests during the selected time interval for the given site.
