As opposed to the usual browsers the CSS support in Java/Swing is limited and does not cover the complete CSS attributes. Therefore Java/Swing will display some CSS attributes flawed or not at all. See also the JavaDoc of the javax.swing.text.html.CSS class for details.

Because of these limitations you should always use the preview function of the CoreMedia Editor for a check of the used CSS styles.
