In order to approve a resource, proceed as follows:


Check in the document (if necessary).


Approve the resource by:



Select File|Approve from the menu bar.

or



Click  in the tool bar.

The document has now been prepared for publication. Approvals are needed both after the creation of a new version of documents, but also after any movement, rename, or withdrawal of publication if the new resource state is supposed to be published. The CoreMedia Editor offers a publication preview for testing whether a publication would be successful. A possible cause of error could be invalid links to other documents. Furthermore, publication fails if not all documents linked to the document to be published are approved. The publication preview does not check for checked-out documents!

To check this:



Select File|preview publication from the menu bar.

or



Click  from the tool bar for publication preview.

The publication window opens and displays whether a publication would be successful or not, and possible causes of failure.
