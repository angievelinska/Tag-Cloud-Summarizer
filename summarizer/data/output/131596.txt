As optional arguments, the IDs or the folder paths of CoreMedia resources can be entered.

Example:

cm serverexport -r -u admin -p admin -b /export 7531

This call of serverexport will export all documents and subfolders (-r) of the folder with the ID 7531 into the /export directory. The program logs in at the server as the admin user, using the admin password (which should never be admin as in the example).
