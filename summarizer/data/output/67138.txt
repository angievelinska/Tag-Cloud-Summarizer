You can edit resources in the workflow window, therefore the amount of usable menu items in the menu bar depends on the selected resource and the user rights. 




The menu bar contains other menu items if you have selected a simple Title-Document instead of a complex document containing multimedia objects.



An editor has fewer rights on a document than an editor-in-chief. A sports editor works on other documents than a politics editor.


Because of the aforementioned reasons, it could be possible that some of the menu items are not visible or usable in your CoreMedia Editor.
