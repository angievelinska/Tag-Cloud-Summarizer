PublishResources

Use this action to publish one or more CoreMedia resources referenced by a variable. If the variable stores an explicit version, that version is published. If no version information is present, the most recent version will be published.

The aggregation variables resultVariable, codeVariable, parameterVariable, and versionVariable jointly represent the result of the publication.
