The LDAP integration which is new since CoreMedia SCI 4.1 has strong implications:



CoreMedia now supports nested groups because Active Directory (and possibly any other LDAP server) has nested groups. The previous group model which does not allow nested groups was not sufficient any longer. 


The CoreMedia User Manager has been completely redesigned to handle large user sets and nested groups.


The computation of user rights was changed due to new nested groups.


A new query interface allows for searching users and groups.


The CoreMedia server has a new update mechanism for users and groups, because LDAP does not provide change events. Instead a new update mechanism based on outdating and refreshing is implemented which also affects the clients, e.g. the CoreMedia User Manager has a new button to load user changes on demand and update the current display.


The login mechanism from CAP 4.0 was changed completely to support built-in and LDAP users. Authentication in CoreMedia SCI is now based on the Java Authentication and Authorization Service. Different JAAS login modules authenticate users from different sources.


CoreMedia SCI implements a different license management. Used licenses are now persistently stored. Free licenses are dynamically consumed when a user logs on to the CoreMedia server. The concept of service groups has been discarded in favor of login predicates. Configurable login predicates prevent user access to certain CoreMedia services, like the editor service.
