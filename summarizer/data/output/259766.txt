To control user access, two basic methods are available: blocking and terminating the user's account. Both methods require that you are viewing the user data in the detailed view mode.

Blocking a user results in the following:

The user can no longer log into the website
The user's data is, however, retained in the database

To block a user, click the Block button. To unblock a user, click the Unblock button.

Deleting a user removes all of the user's data - including any linked ratings, comments or other content - from the system.

To delete a user, click the corresponding icon.
