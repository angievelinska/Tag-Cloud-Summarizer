To deinstall some or all CoreMedia components of a CoreMedia system, a graphical uninstaller exists.

On UNIX platforms the unistaller is started in the /UnInst directory of the CoreMedia installation with the command:

juninst CoreMedia.ju

Under Windows OS, the uninstaller is activated by software administration in the system control panel.
