Error behavior 

Requests which were active at the time of failure are cancelled. Later requests are refused. In both cases a browser displays an error page.  

Error correction 

The watchdog of the ADS detects the failure and restarts the ADS. In the cluster system, the load balancer must remove the failed ADS from its list of active webservers.
