Plugging-in new functionality by simply dropping JAR-, Spring- and JSP-files into the Starter Kit web application and document type definition files into the Content Server is the main goal of the pluggable architecture of the CoreMedia Starter Kit. With this approach, the Starter Kit web application can be extended without modifying existing content bean classes and existing document type definition files. Using the new modular configuration of the Content Application Engine several Plug-Ins can be combined independently. 

To achieve this goal, the following functionality is used or has been added on server- and web-application-side :

Content Server

Properties can be attached to document types without using inheritance and without modifying existing files.
A new XML tag is introduced to define an attachment called DocTypeAspect (see CoreMedia CMS 2008 Administration Manual for details).

Starter Kit web application

Properties attached to a document type by a single Plug-In are represented by means of a separate content bean, the so called aspect content bean.
There can be many aspect content beans from different Plug-In's extending one content bean (the so called aspect aggregator).
Aspects and their aggregator can access each other through the Plug-In API (see Starter Kit API JavaDoc for details).
