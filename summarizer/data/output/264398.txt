Dynamic Content are lists of content items or pages that are dynamically computed. The top viewed items calculated by the Analytics Engine are an example. You will not place these items directly on a page, but use placeholder content, which you add to the page like any other content. The properties of the placeholder content exactly determine the content to display.

All placeholders for dynamic content are sub types of the abstract document type CMDynamicList. It has a property maxLength that defines the maximum number of items in the list. Depending on the data source that generates the dynamic content, fewer items may be displayed. In particular, if the data source returns no items at all, the list will not be shown on the page. How a list is configured to display a certain set of content depends on the actual data source.

The Starter Kit comes with the Analytics Feedback plug-in that generates dynamic content with the Analytics Engine but other Starter Kit plug-ins may add own data sources.
