Alternative to the preselectedResourceId attribute. If both attributes are given the preselectedResourceId takes precedence unless no resource with the given id exists. preselectedResourceId Integer  Id of the preselected resource. Alternative to the preselectedResource attribute. Additional feature available only using the id: Instead of specifying a folder id you may also specify a document id.

That is, you will only see document types which are sub types of the defined document type (including the specified document type unless it is abstract). typePredicate overrides any bounds set. typePredicate Class path  A class of type hox.util.Predicate with a non-arg constructor which filters the shown document types. If you set a typePredicate it overrides any upperBound or lowerBound set. resourceName Name  The name of the new document. If no resource name is defined, the name field will be empty.
