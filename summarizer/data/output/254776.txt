The following sample output of the processes utility shows two simple-publication workflows:

processes: 
  id: coremedia:///cap/process/46, definition: SimplePublication
    (coremedia:///cap/processdefinition/3)
  id: coremedia:///cap/process/26, definition: SimplePublication
    (coremedia:///cap/processdefinition/3)

Use the -v option or the dump tool (see section x.1.1) to obtain details about a process.
