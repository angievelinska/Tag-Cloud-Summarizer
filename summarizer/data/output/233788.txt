CoreMedia CMS offers different APIs and frameworks for the creation of custom clients. 

The Unified API which enables you to implement custom CoreMedia CMS clients from scratch. Taking over session handling and remote communication, it reveals the full functionality of the Content Server and the Workflow Server in a convenient and intuitive abstraction which allows you to concentrate on business logic. See the Unified API Developer Manual for details.
The WebServices Engine, which allows to access the CoreMedia CMS using Web Services. You can use the Unified API or the Content Application Engine to develop your Web Services. See the Delivery Developer Manual for details.
The WAGE API, which enables you to access the CoreMedia CMS using web based clients. The current WebEditor is an implementation of the WAGE API. Read the WAGE Developer Manual for details. You should only use the WAGE API for customization of the WebEditor or if you need workflow functionality in your clients but not for newly designed stand-alone clients. For this tasks use the more modern Editing Services for JSF.  
Editing Services for JSF, a framework which allows to create custom clients to access the CoreMedia repository. It is the successor of the WAGE API and offers many convincing advantages. ES offers for example UI components and reusable beans. It uses modern technology like JSF and Spring and builds on the Unified API and CAE. The Portal Server Integration uses ES  to add editing functionality to portals. Read the Content Application Developer Manual for details.

The Unified API replaces the Scripting API which you might know from CoreMedia SCI 4.2. Old Scripting clients are still supported with CoreMedia CMS 2005, but for new implementations the usage of Scripting API is deprecated. That is why the Scripting API is no longer documented in the developer manuals. Consult the SCI 4.2 manual for maintenance of your legacy Scripting clients.
