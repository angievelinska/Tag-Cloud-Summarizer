A rather complex state chart is shown in Figure. It depicts the various states with respect to publication. Being published, a content gains access to a number of attributes that are only available in this state. Its state space is fragmented into four sub spaces: 

it might be moved 
it might be renamed 
it might be marked for being withdrawn 
it might be marked for being deleted
