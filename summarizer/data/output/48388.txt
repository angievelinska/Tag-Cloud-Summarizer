View Dispatcher




In order to accomodate for the possibilty of defining XML properties of multiple DTDs, the ViewDispatcher has been enhanced to define property templates for each and every DTD. Further, property templates can be defined for each document type (see the programming manual).If you have defined your own property templates, adapt them to the new directory structure.



In general, the 4.1 delivery server does not require the definition of a loopback port in a servlet 2.3 compatible servlet container (such as tomcat 4.1). In this case, change your config.bsh to not specify a loopback port. A loopback port is only necessary if you want to generate/query cached pages from within a Generator-Context that has no request and response set. This especially applies to the Pregenerator which operates autonomously without external requests.
