The single-page dashboard is a collection of reports that refer to statistics of a single page. In contrast to In-Site Analytics, which will be described in section, the information is not displayed in the context of the actual page, but in a format similar to the other reports of the Analytics Dashboard as described in section.

Open the Single-Page Dashboard

The single-page dashboard for a certain page can be opened through a link in the page overlay of In-Site Analytics as described in section.

Content of the Single-Page Dashboard

The standard single-page dashboard is organized like the dashboard described in section, but it is not organized into multiple views that are reachable through tabs. It contains five different reports on the following statistics:

page impressions,
page impressions as a percentage of the site's page impressions,
the percentage of page views of the page that are entries,
the percentage of page views of the page that are exits,
the top external referrers for the page.

For each of the reports it is possible to open a detail report for the same page. The detail report allows to select the time range for which the report is shown.
