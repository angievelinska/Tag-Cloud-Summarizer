To simplify development of CoreMedia Web applications with content editing and workflow functionality, WAGE extends the Struts Web application framework by providing implementations of common Struts interfaces or extensions of Struts classes with CoreMedia support. You can either use these implementations for developing your own Web applications, or further extend them to implement additional functionality specific to your needs.

Both the CoreMedia Authoring Server and Struts dispatch requests to JSPs. Struts uses the ActionMapping and CoreMedia invokes its template finder, usually the ViewDispatcher, which interprets symbolic (template) names as a view (method) of the current resource or property.

With WAGE it is possible to use both: Struts' dispatching mechanism should be used to invoke high-level actions, like login, which are not directly associated with a CoreMedia resource. The CoreMedia template finder should be used for dispatching to templates rendering CoreMedia resources and properties, for example as the result of a Struts action (see ResourceActionForward below). The CoreMedia templates then again use the Struts tag library, for example to submit a form to a Struts action.



WAGE implements this integration by providing you with the following classes, which are implementations of Struts interfaces or extensions to Struts classes:
