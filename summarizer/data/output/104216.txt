The dialog box for external links in RichText fields has the same structure as the dialog box for internal links. The only difference is the Link field; no dialog box exists. Instead you can enter the URL of the link target directly:



3#



Enter the favored values in the fields.



Apply with [OK].


The dialog box closes. The marked text is colored blue and shown underlined. On mouse over the target of the link is shown in the status bar.
