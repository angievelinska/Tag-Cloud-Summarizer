Backup

Before performing a backup, stop all connected feeding applications such as Search Engine Feeders and CAE Feeders. See the FAST Operations Guide for backup instructions.

Reducing the latency of indexing

By default, a change applied to a document appears in the search after  ~90s. As described in the FAST Operations Guide, section "Reducing Indexing Latency", you can reduce this time in the file searchengine/etc/config_data/RTSearch/webcluster/rtsearchrc.xml.

For FAST InStream 4.3:

Set the property flushToDiskInterval to a minimum value of 10. 

Thereby, documents are persisted as FiXML after 10 seconds at the latest. This might lead to a fragmented FiXML-file containing only a few documents, but this is no problem if you have less than 100000 documents. 

Set the property desiredFreshness to a minimum value of 10.

Thereby, the indexer starts indexing after 10 seconds at the latest.

Keep in mind, that both values are minimum settings! In the worst case, indexing will start after 20 seconds. Assuming, that the generation of the first index-partition also takes 20 seconds, you are left with a latency of 40 seconds. 

For FAST ESP 5.1

Set the property latency to the value low.

You have to add the latency of the Feeder to the FAST latency. You can configure the Search Engine Feeder latency which defaults to 10 seconds in the file properties/corem/feeder.xml using the attribute documentDelay of the element <Feeder>.
