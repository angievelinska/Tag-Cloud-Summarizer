This manual describes the customization of the CoreMedia Editor by means of predefined or self-implemented classes. The CoreMedia Editor is a Java Swing application which offers a full-grown editor API to the developer. The editor consists of four main windows which are all subject to configuration:

The Explorer window in which you can inspect and edit the folder and document structure.
The Document window in which you can edit the documents.
The Query window in which you can retrieve information.
The Workflow window in which you can create and edit workflows.
3* Configuration of the first three windows is covered in this manual but the Workflow window is covered in the Workflow Developer Manual.

The next figure shows the Explorer window of the CoreMedia Editor.
