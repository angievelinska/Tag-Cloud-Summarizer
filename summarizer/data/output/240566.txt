The unlockcontentserver tool recovers a database schema after a server aborted without cleaning up the database. In this case it can happen that a persistent lock remains in the database. This lock must be cleared explicitly, because the server would otherwise suspect that a second server is running on the same database.

This utility has the following syntax:

cm unlockcontentserver

You have to run the tool in the server installation where it can access the sql.properties configuration file.
