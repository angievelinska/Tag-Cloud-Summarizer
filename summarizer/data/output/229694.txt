 Property Value Default Description filesystem.documentFileType file or folder file The default mapping used to export documents. If this is set to folder, all document types exported without a filesystem.export.<n>.fileType property are mapped to WebDAV folders. Otherwise they are mapped to WebDAV files. filesystem.appendFileExtension true or false false If true, a file type extension is appended to all documents exported as files. The extension is derived from the MIME-type of the exported property and must be configured in mime.properties. When creating a new document file, the extension will not show up in the document's name but will only be used to set the MIME-type of the stored Blob field. For document file creation, the MIME-type and extension must be configured in mime.properties in a way that it is possible to reconstruct the same extension from the MIME-type without ambiguities. filesystem.export.<n>.docType document type  Defines the exported document type. All document types that inherit from the specified document type are also exported. <n> is a number different for each document type. Properties with the same number <n> belong together. filesystem.export.<n>.fileType file or folder the value of filesystem.documentFileType The mapping used to export documents of the type with number <n>. If this is set to folder, the document type is exported as WebDAV folder, which contains files for its exported fields. Otherwise it is exported as WebDAV file with the content of a single exported field. filesystem.export.<n>.property[.<m >] document field  This property defines the exported fields (also named properties) of the exported document type. For the file mapping, only one field in a document type can be exported. For the folder mapping, replace [.<m>] with different numbers to specify multiple exported fields. filesystem.export.<n>.extension[.<m >] extension  If a client creates a new WebDAV file or folder, a respective document or folder is created in the CoreMedia Content Server. The type of a created document depends on the extension of the created WebDAV file or folder. Set the value of this property to the extension of the file such as .doc for a Word document. Replace <n> with the number for the respective document type. To map multiple extensions to a single document type (e.g. jpg and jpeg), use multiple properties with different numbers for [.<m>]. You can use an asterisk (*) to configure a rule for all not explicitly configured extensions. Note, that it is not possible to mix characters and such an asterisk. filesystem.export.<n>.emptyDocument Path or numeric ID of a document  If the exported field of a document is empty, a zero-byte file appears in the WebDAV folder. Some WebDAV clients such as Microsoft Word 2000 have problems with an empty file. You can configure the WebDAV Server to read the content from a property of a substitute document in the repository. Replace <n> with the number of the exported document type and <path|id> with the path or numeric ID of the substitute document. The user needs read rights on this document. All further changes like save or delete are performed not on the substitute document, but on the originally selected document with the initially empty field.
