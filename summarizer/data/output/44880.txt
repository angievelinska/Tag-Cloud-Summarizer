GeneralTransformerFactoryImpl has further features: the transformers instantiated with this class automatically receive some parameters without these having to be explicitly configured. In particular, these are

the name of the transformer (i.e. the value of the import.transformer.xx.name property)
a log object which the transformer can use for log outputs
a CoreMedia object which enables access to the CoreMedia repository

Details of the classes of these objects can be found in the Importer-API and in the Scripting-API.
