However, every medal has two sides. The drawbacks of using XSLT are:

It does not integrate well with Java, i.e. it is not possible to simply call a Java method from a stylesheet.
Processing can use a lot of memory since the entire input tree and stylesheet need to be in-memory.
Processing can be slow depending on XPath expressions and sortings used.
Writing stylesheets can be difficult due to syntactic issues.
