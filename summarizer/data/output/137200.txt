Prior to using the commands, you have to check the access control. Requests are only accepted, if



their origin is the same computer as the one the Editor is running on and


their command is activated in the remote control policy file.

The remote control policy file $INSTALL_DIR/properties/policy/editor.policy is a standard Java policy file and may be edited with the Java policy tool. It grants execute rights to commands by specifying the name and the package of the command.
