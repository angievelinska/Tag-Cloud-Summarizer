Integrate your command into the CoreMedia Editor using editor.xml

There are no elements in the editor.xml to integrate the commands directly. You need to subclass an editor or view class.



Integrate the command into the document view




3* In this case you need to extend the hox.corem.editor.generic.GenericDocumentView class. The class can be added to the editor.xml file using the attribute viewClass

 of the element Document. See section for an example.




Integrate the command into the explorer view




3* You simply need to set your own explorer view using the attribute explorerViewClass of the element FrameFactory in the editor.xml file. See section for an example.
