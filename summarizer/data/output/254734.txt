The CoreMedia Content Server provides JMX access for management and monitoring. 

Two protocols are supported:

jmxmp
Hessian with or without SSL

jmxmp is the standard for JMX but if you apply the Hessian protocol, you can use the integrated Http-Server of the Content Management Server to connect to, thus saving a port. Hessian also requires authentication, thus improving security. In addition, you can use a https connection to the web server with the Hessian protocol. Section describes how to configure an SSL connection for the integrated Http-Server.

Enabling JMX-support

In order to enable JMX-support you have to add the URL of the connection server to the property cap.server.management.jmxremote.url in the contentserver.properties file.
