 Property Value Default Description publisher.local.user string publisher The user name for logging in locally to the Content Management Server. publisher.local.domain string  The domain for logging in locally to the Content Management Server. publisher.local.password string publisher The password for logging in locally to the Content Management Server. publisher.target.ior.url http://<LiveServerMasterComputerName>:<PORT>/coremedia/ior N/A The URL where the publisher can obtain the IOR of the Master Live Server (required, single-site mode only). publisher.target.user string publisher The user name for logging in to the Master Live Server (single-site mode only). publisher.target.domain string  The domain for logging in to the Master Live Server (single-site mode only). publisher.target.password string publisher The password for logging in to the Master Live Server (single-site mode only). publisher.target.<n>.{ior.url,user,domain,password} (see above) (see above) Login data for the publisher. These values correspond to the four properties above, but different numeric values of n are used to distinguish publication targets (multi-site mode only). publisher.target.<n>.name intranet publication-target-<n> The permanent and unique name of the publication target. Once set, it should never be changed, as this name is used for target identification in the APIs and in JMX (multi-site mode only). publisher.target.<n>.display.name Intranet value of publisher.target.<n>.name The display name is shown to users when no localized information about a publication target is available; display names, too, should be unique, but they may well change to better illustrate the current uses of a publication target (multi-site mode only). publisher.target.<n>.folders comma-separated list of names and/or ids of base folders, e.g., intranet, download, 4711  The base folders that are assigned to a publication target. This property typically references exactly one top-level folder, either by name or by its numerical id. If more than one site is generated from a single Live Server, multiple top-level folders may be given, separated by commas. When indicating a folder by name, that name is blocked for rename operations on the top-level folder. Once you have assigned a folder to a publication target, it must not be reassigned to another target. Doing so would result in inconsistencies between Content Management Server and Master Live Server (multi-site mode only). publisher.enableBypassPreviews true / false true Whether publication previews bypass ("true") or not ("false") the publication queue for faster response times. publisher.autoextend.latestApprovedVersion true/false false 

This property affects the automatic extension of publication sets. The default behaviour ("false") is as follows:

If the referenced document is not published yet, publish its earliest approved version.
If the referenced document is already published, do nothing

If set to "true", not the earliest but the latest (= newest) approved version is published. publisher.autoextend.updateLinkedDocuments true/false false This property affects the automatic extension of publication sets. By default ("false") only direct linked and approved documents are added to the publication set. If set to "true" all linked documents are recursively added to the publication set. The recursion stops when a version is already published and may lead to surprisingly large publication sets. Setting updateLinkedDocuments implicitly also sets latestApprovedVersion. publisher.destroyIntermediateVersions true / false true Whether intermediate document versions between two publications will be destroyed ("true") or not ("false") on the Content Management Server. Example: Version 1 of document A was published. In the meantime, the versions 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been created. When you now publish version 5, the versions 2, 3, 4 are destroyed and only version 1 and 5 remain on the Content Server. publisher.destroyOlderVersionsOnLiveServers true / false true Whether older published versions should be destroyed ("true") on the Master Live Server. That is, only two published versions (the current and the one before) of each document remain on the Master Live Server. Only change if you have a valid reason. publisher.priority.gui.editor 0...99 60 The priority of publications requested through the CoreMedia Editor (default 60). publisher.priority.scripting 0...99 40 The priority of publications requested through either the Unified API or the Scripting API (default 40). publisher.priority.generator 0...99 40 The priority of publications requested through the ADS (default 40). publisher.priority.jpython 0...99 20 The priority of publications requested through jpython code (obsolete, default 40). publisher.priority.importer 0...99 20 The priority of publications requested through an importer (default 20). publisher.priority.unknown 0...99 20 The priority of publications of unknown origin.
