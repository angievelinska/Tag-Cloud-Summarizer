In offline generation mode, the page cache size configuration is ignored. In order to regenerate affected pages on change, all reachable pages are generated and kept in the cache, regardless of the setting. If you run into space problems, you can reduce the amount of cached pages by making fragment templates non-cacheable, possibly at the expense of fragment reuse and thus generation time. 

The bean property preGenerateTransactionally can be used to configure the behaviour of the ADS when the data on the server is changed. If data is changed on the server, the ADS receives events which inform it about the changes. The Active Delivery Server must then invalidate the corresponding pages and (pre)generate them anew. 

With preGenerateTransactionally=true, the changes are processed transactionally. This means that before generation, the documents that need to be changed are determined, and only these documents are changed, even if new events occur during generation. The new events are only taken into consideration in the next generation. 

On the other hand, with preGenerateTransactionally=false, change events which occur during the generation phase are immediately taken into consideration. 

A pregenerator in transactional mode must be connected to Live Server to generate pages after content changes. If it is connected to a ContentServer, the generated pages will not be updated, because the begin of a transaction is signaled by a publication event.  

The following section from config.bsh configures the ADS so that events during the generation phase are taken into consideration immediately:
