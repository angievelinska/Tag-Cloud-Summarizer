Rendering Hints

You might send "rendering hints" to the portal server which causes the backend resources (e.g. a page or a binary) to rendered in a specific way. Rendering hints are represented as special response headers which can be set using HttpServletResponse#addHeader(<hint-name>,<hint-value>).
