The pages which are delivered to the portlets by the CAE need to be XHTML 1.0 (described in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) compliant. A very simple portlet page may look like


<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
 <head>
  <title>My Portlet Page Title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <p>Hello World!</p>
 </body>
</html>

The portlet interprets and transforms these pages and embeds them as a single fragment into a higher level portal page. Due to this transformation process there are XHTML related things may cause the rendering behave not exactly as expected. This has to be considered when writing a XHTML based portal application:

XHTML is case sensitive. Use lowercase elements and attributes only
The XHTML namespace (http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml) should be used for all elements
Although you may use XHTML's standard linking attributes, the links itself need to be written as Portal Link 1.0, e.g. <a href="portal-page:///content/1234"> or <img src="portal-binary:///contentblob/12/Image">. In addition, links which are dynamically generated by javascript won't work in most cases.
Most elements below <head> will be ignored. Exceptions are 
<title>, 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[portal link]"/> and 
<script type="text/javascript" src="[portal link]"/>.
Inside element <form> the method POST should be used rather than GET.
Encodings application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data are supported only for <form>.
The element <body>'s attributes will be ignored completely.

Some portal servers are providing a mechanism where a portlet may define a "local" navigation. Such navigations are structured hierarchical and are embedded in the portal's navigation automatically while preserving the portal's look & feel. When writing your portlet page's templates, you may add some special (and therefore not XHTML compliant) markup code in order to provide a navigation for your page. Below the <head> element you have to embed one or more <pml:navigation>  elements like

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
...  
<pml:navigation 
  id="portal-navigation"
  xmlns:pml="http://www.coremedia.com/cms/portal/pml/1.0" 
  xmlns:plink="http://www.coremedia.com/cms/portal/link/1.0" 
  label="Link To My Page"
  plink:uri="portal-page:///mypage1">

  <pml:navigation label="Another Link" 
   plink:uri="portal-page:///mypage2"/>
  
</pml:navigation>
  
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

A <pml:navigation> is a hierarchically structured navigation node which consists of

An URI (attribute plink:uri="...") which describes the navigation node's link target using the Portal Link 1.0 notation (see above)
A link label (attribute label="...")
A flag (attribute selected="true|false") which indicates whether the link is "currently active" and therefore shall be displayed in a highlighted way. This feature is not supported by all portal servers.

When using this navigation feature, you have to make sure that the top level navigation element contains an attribute id="portal-navigation" as well as the namespace definitions xmlns:pml="http://www.coremedia.com/cms/portal/pml/1.0" and xmlns:plink="http://www.coremedia.com/cms/portal/link/1.0".
