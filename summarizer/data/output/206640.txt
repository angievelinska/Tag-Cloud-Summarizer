depth 

The JndiNameLoginPredicate is not restricted to the user¿s JNDI name but may also consider the JNDI names of the groups, he is member of. The integer value specifies the depth of group nesting (defaults to 0). '-1' means the nesting is unrestricted. The values are logically or-ed. If one of the values matches the regular expression, the predicate returns true.

E.g. with depth=0 only the JNDI name of the user is used. With depth=1 the JNDI names of the user and the JNDI names of his direct groups are matched against the regular expression.
