AddLatestVersion

Grammar: ( (Expression)* ) 

An AddLatestVersion expression adds the latest version to a document value or to each member of an aggregate containing only documents. If a document already contains version information, the value is handed through. Otherwise, the Content Management Server is queried for the latest version of the document and the document version is added.
