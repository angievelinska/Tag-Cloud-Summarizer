Using the methods of the hox.corem.servlets.Folder class of the Generator API, the following is possible for a given folder:


call up the child resource with a given name

call up an array of all child documents. Filtering according to document type is possible.

call up an array of all direct or transitive sub-directories

call up an array of all child resources (i.e. both folders and documents). Again filtering is possible.


The order of the resources delivered is undefined. It is therefore desirable to sort the resources before use. As usual in Java, the java.util.Arrays#sort method is used for sorting, to which a comparative operator is passed (java.util.Comparator). To make the creation of suitable comparative operators easier, CoreMedia offers the hox.corem.servlets.beans.ComparatorFactory class. See Example 4.2.3b for a template which uses this bean.
