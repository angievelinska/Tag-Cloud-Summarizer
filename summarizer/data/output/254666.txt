If you have invoked this command successfully, the CoreMedia component is registered. You can check this using the service list window which you can open with ControlPanel|Administrative Tools|Component Services|Services (Local). You can execute the install command as often as you want, but note that the old entry will not be deleted if the value of SERVICE_NAME in the jpif-file of the component was changed.

Deregistration of CoreMedia components as Windows Services is described in chapter. You can also perform these tasks (and some more) with the help of sc.exe, a Microsoft command-line utility.
