Using the dataaggregator tool you can control the lifecycle of the Data Aggregator process inside a Workflow Server. Content Server and Workflow Server must be running before the tool is invoked. The following subcommands are possible:

The command init uploads the process definition as stored in the file properties/corem/data-aggregator.xml to the Workflow Server. Invoke this command after the Workflow Server has been started for the first time and after every update. At your option, you may also use the upload tool.
The command start starts a Data Aggregator process or complains if one is already running.
The command restart stops an already running Data Aggregator, if such a process already exists. Afterwards, a new Data Aggregator is started.
The command shutdown performs a soft shutdown of an already running Data Aggregator and waits until the process is terminated. The current iteration will be completed first.
The command stop performs a quick shutdown of an already running Data Aggregator. This is not recommended, but may be required if the running Data Aggregator hangs due to escalated tasks.
The command once starts a Data Aggregator process and makes sure that it stops immediately after a single iteration. This is useful for test purposes in order to analyze the system state after an iteration. If another process is already running, no action is taken at all.
The command status prints information about the state of the aggregation process, for example about the current settings of variables and about running and escalated tasks.
