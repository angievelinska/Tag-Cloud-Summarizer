The most common kind of task is the user task, which is executed by participants of the workflow.

When defining a user task, first consider the rule that selects which users to offer the task. Usually, the appropriate users are selected from their groups. For each group, a list of rights on the task is given, where accept is the most important one for user tasks. For special requirements, you can implement your own business logic in a WfPerformersPolicy.

For a user task a client view has to be given. A client defines a view on the variables of the workflow that may be read and/or modified. For resource variables, you can additionally determine whether the referred content may be editable.

To make workflow more convenient for the participants, user task's actions have access to various functions of the CoreMedia Editor. While an automated task can change resources (e.g. check out a document), a user task can even open a document view or start a publication with graphical feedback. For a list of possible actions, see Section 6.1 and Section 4.4.

Validators (see Section 4.1.6.4) have a special feature in the context of a client view. If a validator fails and provides a description, it is displayed as an error message in a client view. Like task descriptions, validator error messages may be localized (see Section 4.1.3.1).
