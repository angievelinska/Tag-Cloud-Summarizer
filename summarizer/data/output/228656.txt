Interactive Report Drill Down

The Top Entry Pages report model provides the following three report parameters:

The site parameter determines the (sub-)site. The list of sites is automatically generated during report data aggregation.
The number of entries parameter determines the number of top entries to display. Please note that technically this is an 'entry range' parameter, thus a simple extension of the available value set would allow entries like 'top 5-10' or blocks like '1-10', '11-20', etc. See the Analytics Developer Manual on how to extend report variables.
The time interval parameter allows a user to select the time interval. See the Performance report for time interval description and screenshots.

As the Top Entry Pages report is not a time series report, no time resolution parameter is provided.
