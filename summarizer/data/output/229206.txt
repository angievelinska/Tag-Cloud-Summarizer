In the following, you will find a discussion of full deployments that include all components of the CoreMedia Analytics Engine. For low-traffic sites, you can use the Analytics Data Aggregator simultaneously as the Workflow Server for editorial processes. For high-traffic sites, this is not recommended, because the log processing may slow down the editorial processes too much. Therefore, a standalone Analytics Data Aggregator is recommended for high-traffic sites.

Standalone Deployment

This deployment consists of:

a Content Management Server,
a Master Live Server,
a Workflow Server,
an Analytics Data Aggregator,
an Object Analyzer,


a preview servlet engine (for example a Tomcat), containing

a preview CAE with In-Site Analytics and
an Analytics Dashboard,
a delivery CAE enabled for click tracking,
databases for the servers and for the Analytics Engine.

The following figure illustrates the deployment assuming a firewall between Content Management Environment and Content Delivery Environment.
