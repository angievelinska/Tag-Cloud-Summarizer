After being created using the Cap.connect(...) methods, a connection is open immediately, i.e., its methods can be invoked and all read and write accesses to the associate repositories are possible, too. A connection that was created through Cap.prepare(...) starts off closed. It has to be opened by a call to open().

An open connection will stay open until closed explicitly. In particular, an open connection does not become eligible for garbage collection simply by discarding references to it. There are a number of active threads inside a Unified API connection that will keep the connection alive until explicitly closed.

After you have closed the connection, all stateful objects that were retrieved from the connection become non-functional, in particular the repositories, services and CapObjects. Immutable objects like strings or markup objects generally remain intact, but blobs become unusable. 

Operations on Closed Connections

The only operations that are possible on a closed or not yet opened connection are calls to setters and getters for the connection parameters like user name or password.

Management of Open Connections

While a connection is open, you can also access the connection's management bean as provided by the getMBean() method. These are the configurable parameters:
