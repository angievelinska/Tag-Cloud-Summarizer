The CAE Feeder supports String, Number, Date, XML and binary element values. The Search Engine extracts and indexes the plain text from XML and binary elements. Text extraction is part of the document processing phase which runs before the actual indexing takes place. FAST supports text extraction for a large number of binary formats. See the FAST Product Overview Guide, chapter ¿Supported Document Formats¿ for a list of supported formats. 

If the Search Engine or some of its components is unavailable or unable to process indexing requests, the CAE Feeder retries feeding until it succeeds. This includes reconnecting to a restarted Search Engine. For indexing errors that were caused by the data in a Feedable, an error document is indexed as placeholder for the original document. An example for such an error is a Feedable which contains binary data of an unsupported format. The error document replaces the original document. Error documents contain the value ERROR in the field feederstate and a description of the error in the field feederinfo. The next successful update or remove of the document removes the error document again. You can search for error documents with the query string feederstate:ERROR.

Note, that there are more possible values for the field feederstate but only the value SUCCESS denotes a successfully indexed document. A query for successfully indexed documents must include the condition feederstate:SUCCESS. See the comment for the field feederstate in the default index profile or the API documentation of com.coremedia.cap.feeder.FeedableElement for possible values.
