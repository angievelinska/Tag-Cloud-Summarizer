If you want to set up the CoreMedia Content Server now, click [Yes]. If you want to configure later manually, click [No]. You have to do the basic configuration in the corresponding property files in the directory ./properties/corem later (for a detailed description of the properties see Chapter 5).

If you decide to carry on with the set-up, dialog-boxes will ask you for the properties of the selected CoreMedia SCT components. In the subsequent dialog boxes all paths are given relative to the installation directory.

Now, the dialog box for configuring contentserver.properties is shown.
