The picture above shows the request flow if the user clicked a button inside the pbe context menu. Again the content portlet receives the request and forwards it to the backend, i.e. the portal application. In this case the counterpart of the ContextMenuRenderer -the ActionExecutionController- is receiving the request. Also this controller is described in more detail in the next sections. The ActionExecutionController is responsible for reacting on the selection of the user. This is done by executing actions, which  are also described in the next sections. The execution of the actions is part of the editing services framework. The result of the ActionExecutionController is defined by the actions and is usually a redirect to another page. That page is then again rendered in the portal.
