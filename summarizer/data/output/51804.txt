The document view of the CoreMedia Editor is created by the class hox.corem.editor.generic.GenericDocumentView. This class builds a container for a menu bar, a tool bar and a property section which contains the data of the document. If you want to use own commands in the menu bar or  tool bar of the document view you need to extend GenericDocumentView and overwrite the method getComponent which returns a JComponent. Follow the steps described in the next table.
