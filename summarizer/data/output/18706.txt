An administrator configures the watchdog in the watchdog.xml file. The watchdog executes actions to check the watched components and executes further actions depending on the check results. The watched components, the actions and the mapping from actions to actions are described by XML elements. The mapping from actions to actions is defined by <Edge/> tags. 


The general XML file structure is as follows:


	<Watchdog>


		<Component>


			<AnActionElement/>


			<Edge/>


		</Component>


		<Component>


			<AnActionElement/>


			<Edge/>


		</Component>


	</Watchdog>


<AnActionElement> is a place holder for one of several possible action elements. <Component>, <AnActionElement/> and <Edge/> can occur multiple times.


In the configuration file, components are linked with actions. The following code example shows a watchdog.xml file.
