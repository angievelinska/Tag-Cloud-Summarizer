The publish tool publishes the very latest versions (including working revisions of checked out documents) of the specified resources immediately. This includes all mandatory preliminary actions:



Checking in the resource


Approving the latest version


Approving the place (for the whole path)

publish does not cause dead links on the master server but also publishes all referenced resources if necessary. However, those referenced resources are not published as eagerly as the specified resources. If a referenced resource is already published, nothing is done. Otherwise the latest approved version is published. If there is no approved version, the very latest version is published.
