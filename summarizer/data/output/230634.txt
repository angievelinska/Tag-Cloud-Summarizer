The preceding sections have introduced the <es:button>-tag and have shown how to use predefined actions and the actionFactory utility to set the action's target. The toolbar interface com.coremedia.editing.action.Toolbar defines the method getAvailableActions(Object):List that returns a list of actions that are available for a given target object. Using the <es:forEach>-tag you can easily define a toolbar that works on the model of the current view. You simply have to set the list of available actions as value of the forEach component as shown below. The bean named contentToolbar is a predefined bean of type com.coremedia.editing.kits.jsf.action.ToolbarController that wraps a toolbar in order to make it accessible using JSF expression language. The expression #{contentToolbar.actions[document]} evaluates to the list of actions that are available for the bean named document.
