Global configuration options for WAGE are accessed through an application scope bean with the default name wageConfig that should be instantiated in the config.bsh of the Authoring Server.

The wageConfig bean must be an instance of com.coremedia.cap.wage.WageConfig. The JavaDoc of that class contains information on what can be configured. In table-configs, you find an overview of all configuration options and a short description. All properties can be read and modified, but are usually only modified in the config.bsh.
