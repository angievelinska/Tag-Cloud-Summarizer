Feeding the Search Engine

The Search Engine Feeder is enabled or disabled in the configuration of the CoreMedia Content Server. You can change the configuration at runtime to stop and restart feeding without restarting the CoreMedia Content Server.

When the Search Engine Feeder starts the first time, it iterates over the documents in the repository and sends them to the Search Engine for indexing. After this initialization phase, the Search Engine Feeder sends documents to the Search Engine after they have changed.

When the Search Engine Feeder restarts it automatically continues its work with the next document that needs to be indexed. This document is determined from a timestamp stored by the Search Engine Feeder in the same collection of the Search Engine. During restart the Search Engine Feeder retrieves the timestamp from the Search Engine to continue feeding.

The CoreMedia Search Engine indexes textual data from document properties and a number of metadata attributes such as the path of the document, the name of its creator and the last time the document was published. In the configuration of the Search Engine Feeder you can restrict the indexed documents by their type and its indexed properties by their name and type. Note, that the CoreMedia Search Engine only indexes the latest document version.
