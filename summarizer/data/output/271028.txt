If you want web site users to maximize, minimize and restore portlet windows, or change the portlet mode, you can add a window frame containing the required controls. An example for such a portlet window frame is included with the CoreMedia Lightweight Portal.

You can activate window controls for a portlet window by configuring the CLiPexample viewtype in the CMPortletWindow document. The CLiPexample viewtype associates the portlet window with the provided example layout (see section 2.4. Adding Portlet Window Controls for the documentation of its installation).

Attaching the example layout to a portlet window

In order to attach the CLiP example layout to a portlet window you have to perform the following steps in the content repository using the editor:
Open the CMPortletWindow you want to be rendered using the example layout
Add the viewtype CLiPexample to the field viewtype
Go to the channel in which you added the portlet window as content and set the field Associated CSS to /System/Portlets/CLiP_example_layout/css/CLiPexample.css

Removing the example layout from a portlet window

To remove the window controls from a portlet window, you have to perform the following steps:
Open the CMPortletWindow you want to update
Remove the viewtype CLiPexample from the field viewtype, leaving it empty.

There is no need to remove the associated CSS from the channel, as it may still be used by other portlet windows.
