Interface to implement

Own performer policies must implement the interface com.coremedia.workflow.WfPerformersPolicy. The important method is calculateAssignment(WfTaskInstance taskInstance, WfUser[] permittedUsers) which is called by the CoreMedia Workflow Server. It returns a WfUserAssignment object (see the Workflow API documentation for details).

Default implementation

If you only want to adapt the default performer policy to your needs it would be easier to subclass the default performer policy DefaultPerformersPolicy and to override the appropriate methods.

Defining the policy in the workflow definition

In Example 5.7a you see how to define your own performer policy in the workflow definition.
