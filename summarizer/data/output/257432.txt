The unique visitors report shows the number of distinct visitors who visited a given site in a certain time interval. A visitor who returns to the site is not counted twice within the time resolution unit. For example, a report may be resolved to days, covering a week. If a visitor visits the site twice on Monday, but only once on Tuesday, this report will show a single unique user for both days.

The possible choices for variables and the offered actions for this report are identical to those of the performance report described in section, but only a single time series is shown, namely the number of unique users for each time interval.
