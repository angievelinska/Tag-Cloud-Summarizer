The CoreMedia system uses so-called "content types" to describe the internal structure of documents. Therefore, before you can work with content a "content type model" must be installed. Each document type, except the root type, inherits from a parent type, or in other words, a hierarchical type system organizes the content. For more information on document types please refer to the CoreMedia Administration Manual.

The Web Service of this section will offer two methods allowing to access all type data. In addition to the already introduced ContentMetaData two other portable artifacts are needed: one describing the type generally and one for the property details.
