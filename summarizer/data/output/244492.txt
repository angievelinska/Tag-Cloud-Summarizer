To convert the workflows, use the cm workflowconverter utilitiy as follows:
Stop the CoreMedia Workflow Server with cm workflowserver stop.
Copy the changed classes (if any) into the appropriate directories.
Start the workflowconverter utility. Note that the conversion only takes place, if the -c or -X flag is given.
Finally start the workflow server again with cm workflowserver start.
