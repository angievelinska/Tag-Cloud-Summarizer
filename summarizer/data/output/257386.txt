The CoreMedia Workflow Global Search and Replace is designed for searching and replacing text in more than one document. In the WebEditor it's only partly possible to execute the workflow, because the actual search and replace must be done in the CoreMedia Editor. In the WebEditor, the user can execute the following steps:



Select the documents to search in and start the workflow.



Collect more documents to search in.



Define the search options.



Delegate or reject the search-and-replace task or execute the task in the CoreMedia Editor. 


You find a description how to execute the search-and-replace task in the CoreMedia Editor in Kapitel.
