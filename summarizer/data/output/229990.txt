Words

Words are composed of one or several words which are separated by spaces. A words is composed of the characters "a" to "z", "A" to "Z" and the digits from "1" to "9". Permitted words are for example:

railway,A10 or 1x1

There is no distinction between lower case letters and capitals. The following words all give the same result set:

Car, car CAr

Several words are combined by a logical AND. E.g. highway 66 will find all documents which contain the words highway and 66. 

You can use a minus ("-")or plus ("+") sign in front of a word. The plus sign is optional and has no meaning. E.g. highway and +highway will give the same results. The minus sign excludes the following word from the search result. E.g. highway -66 will find all documents which contain highway and do not contain 66. No space is allowed between the plus/minus and the word.

You can use the wildcards '*' and '?' in a word. The wildcard '*' represents an arbitrary number of characters. The wildcard '?' represents any single character. For example: car* will find all documents with words starting with car.

Sentence

A sentence defines a fixed order of words and is limited by quotation marks. E.g. "highway 66" will find all documents which contain the word highway followed by 66. Plus and minus signs in a sentence will be ignored.
