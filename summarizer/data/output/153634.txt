In order to secure your portal application against unauthorized access you may want to enable HTTP Basic Authentication and/or SSL on servlet container level. When using Tomcat as servlet container you have to edit

Tomcat's conf/server.xml and enable the SSL connector. This is self-described in the file.
The portal application's WEB-INF/web.xml and enable the sections <security-constraint>, <login-config> and <security-role> like

<security-constraint>
 <web-resource-collection>
  <web-resource-name>secured portal backend</web-resource-name>
  <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  <http-method>DELETE</http-method>
  <http-method>GET</http-method>
  <http-method>POST</http-method>
  <http-method>PUT</http-method>
 </web-resource-collection>

 <auth-constraint>
  <role-name>myPortalUserRole</role-name>
 </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>

<login-config>
 <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
 <realm-name>CoreMedia CMS Portal Integration</realm-name>
</login-config>

<security-role>
 <description>Portal User</description>
 <role-name>myPortalUserRole</role-name>
</security-role>

In addition you have to add the above referenced roles to the tomcat user database. Please see the servlet specification as well as the Tomcat documentation for further informations.
