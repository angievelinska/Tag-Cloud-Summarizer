The order of the field elements in the example corresponds to the order of the fields in the definition of the document type Text, but this is not required, as any order can be used. 

CoreMedia XML supports the document fields of type structured and unstructured text, number, date, blob and linklist.These are now described in detail. All field elements have an attribute name for the document field. The attribute is not explicitly listed below.

<text>

Corresponds to an <XmlProperty> in the document type definition. The CoreMedia DTD allows #PCDATA as content, the format of the <text> content deviates at this point from the DTD: the content of <text> must conform to the grammar DTD defined for the field.

<string>

Corresponds to a <StringProperty> in the document type definition. The attribute value holds the string content.

<string name="Heading" value="New market on descent/>

<integer>

Corresponds to an <IntProperty> in the document type definition. The attribute value contains the number.

<integer name="Priority" value="42"/>

<date>

Corresponds to a <DateProperty> in the document type definition. In addition to the name attribute, there are three further attributes:



date: the date must be entered in the format yyyy-mm-dd, e.g. 2001-11-06


time: the time must be entered in the format hh:mm, e.g. 09:00 or hh:mm:ss, e.g. 23:59:59


timezone: the format corresponds to the Java 2 API (java.util.TimeZone ), e.g. Europe/Berlin or GMT.

All three attributes are optional. If date is left out, the whole date is undefined. On the other hand, the default values 00:00 and java.util.TimeZone.getDefault() are used for time and timezone, resp.

<date name="AutoPdate" date="2001-01-01" time="12:15" timezone="Europe/Berlin"/>

<blob>

Corresponds to a <BlobProperty> in the document type definition. The element has two further attributes:



mimetype: the MIME type must match the MIME type defined in the corresponding <BlobProperty> element in the definition of the document type. Wildcards, like image/* are not allowed.


href: the URL of a Blob. It is given either absolute or relative to the value of the xml:base attribute of the <coremedia> element.

<blob name="onlineImage" mimetype="image/jpeg" href="chart.jpg"/>

<linklist>

Corresponds to a <LinkListProperty> in the document type definition. It can have both <document> and <link> child elements. <document> children are imported like other <document> elements. The empty element <link> has an attribute idref with an Id value. The consistency rules given above apply to these idrefs. All documents of a <linklist> must have a type that corresponds to the type specified with the LinkType attribute of the corresponding <LinkListProperty>.

<linklist name="Images"><link idref="pic1"/></linklist>
