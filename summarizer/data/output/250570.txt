A resource naming factory creates and modifies names of resources and folders. This is intended to enable customization of how resources and folders are named or renamed in different projects.

Interface to implement

Own resource naming factories must implement hox.corem.editor.ResourceNamingFactory. Please read the Editor API for more details.

Classes to subclass

The easiest way to write own resource naming factories is to subclass BasicResourceNamingFactory and to overwrite the appropriate methods. Please read the Editor API for more details.

Integrate your resource naming factory into the CoreMedia Editor using editor.xml

You can integrate your resource naming factory  into the CoreMedia Editor using the attribute class of the ResourceNamingFactory element as shown in example.
