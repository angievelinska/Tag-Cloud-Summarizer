The predefined Top External Search Terms Report (see screenshot) displays a ranking of search terms used by visitors in popular external search engines to find and enter your site. Technically, entry page requests (requests that originate from a different site) are scanned to determine whether they originate from an external search engine's result page, and if so, the search term used in the search engine is recorded. Because the request format of search engines is not standardized, not all requests can be detected as requests from a search engine. Requests from the following search engines are recognized:

www.google.com
www.altavista.com
www.lycos.com
www.dogpile.com
www.msn.com
www.search.com
www.aol.com
www.alltheweb.com

The term 'external search engine' refers to search engines outside the scope of a CoreMedia CMS system installation, e.g. Google, Altavista, etc.

Please note that you cannot refine your report to select a specific external search engine.
