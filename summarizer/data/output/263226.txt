To offer you a ready-made website, the Starter Kit uses the new modular configuration to plug into the CAE. It provides the typical artifacts needed to implement a website with the CAE, namely content beans, links schemes, controllers, templates, and utilities. The Starter Kit also utilizes Preview-Based Editing (PBE) to give the editorial staff direct access from the website to the content. The reoccurring features navigation (see websitestruct) and internationalization (i18n) are reflected in all these extensions. To build the website layout, HTML output is created through CAE views (JSP templates) and CSS is stored in CMS documents (see section JSP templates). The Starter Kit not only plugs into the CAE, but also provides its own API that you can use to customize the content application in your project, or to build a Starter Kit Plug-In (see section plugin).
