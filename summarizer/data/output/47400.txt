This chapter explains some of the basic features of WAGE  with the help of an example - how a property of a CoreMedia resource can be read and changed. It shows the basic steps necessary for implementing your own WAGE-based Web application:

implementing a view which will render a form for changing property values of a CoreMedia resource
implementing an action performing the business logic, for example to update a CoreMedia resource
implementing an ActionForm, which is used to transfer data between the model and the view layers
configuring your Web application

This example also explains some of the most common Struts features and tags. For more details on Struts please refer to the Struts documentation.
