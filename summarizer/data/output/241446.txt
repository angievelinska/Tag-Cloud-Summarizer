The CoreMedia CMS is being used for developing content applications in various scenarios, including Web sites, where editorial content is presented to a large number of Web users.

Recently, CoreMedia CMS is increasingly applied as a platform for intranets and within portal servers. Distributed and casual users cause an increasing need for content editing over the Web.

In contrast to Web site projects where content is managed only by a small group of dedicated editors (not by the Web user), in an intranet or portal project each web user edits content and participates in content workflows.

Therefore, a large number of users has to be able to edit CoreMedia resources and to participate in workflows using a Web front-end.

This manual describes how to develop Web applications with the CoreMedia Web Application Extensions of the Active Delivery Server (WAGE, the G comes from the old name of the ADS, Generator), a set of building blocks for CoreMedia Web applications with resource editing and workflow functionality.

The manual consists of the following parts:



an overview of the WAGE architecture and the building blocks used to create own Web applications in Chapter 2


some examples on how WAGE can be utilized in Chapter 3


a reference-style listing of the WAGE tag library in Chapter 4
