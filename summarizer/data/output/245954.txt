Configuration in System Landscape

You can configure the portal application URL in the file contentservice.xml  inside the portal archive as described in section  or in the SAP System Landscape. You can create a system with the portal application URL from a deployed portal archive. Before deploying the portal archive you must configure the system alias in the file contentservice.xml  inside the portal archive: Remove the properties endpoint and authentication  from the content service definition and add the following bean below the element beans and configure a system alias in property systemAlias:

  <bean id="contentServiceCustomizer1" 
   class="com.coremedia.portal.sapep.service.SystemContentServiceCustomizer">

  <property name="customizedBeanName" 
   value="contentservice_1"/>

  <property name="systemAlias"
   value="[system alias]"/>

  </bean>


After deploying the portal archive as described in the next subsection, you can create a system in the System Landscape Editor with the following steps:
Change to System Administration | System Configuration | System Landscape
Select a folder in the Portal Content Directory where you want to create the system.
Right-click on the folder and select New From PAR | System
Select the portal archive com.coremedia.cms.portal  as source for the system and click Next.
Select the portal component CoreMediaPortalApplication  and click Next.
Enter required system properties like name and id and click Next and Finish.
Open the new system for edit and configure the URL of the portal application in the property webservice URL  in the system definition.
Configure user and password in the properties webservice user and webservice password  if the portal application is secured with basic authentication.
Change to Display | System Aliases. Create a system alias that matches the one configured in the file contentservice.xml.
Refresh the portal application com.coremedia.cms.portal (e.g. by using the PRT Admin Console) in order to make these changes take effect.

If you need multiple systems, you can edit the created system to be a system template by changing the property Is a template in the system editor to true. Afterwards you can create more systems based on the system template with New | System.

Accessing the Portlet Content

Typically, accessing a portlet is done implicitly by navigating through the portal application. In some cases, it might be useful to access a portlet directly by simply using a "stable" URL. This is supported by the Enterprise Portal when using URLs like http://host:port/irj/portal?NavigationTarget=ROLES://portal_content/folder/role/workset/page/iview, where the NavigationTarget-parameter's value is the PCD Location of the iView. 

If you additionally want to access a special page inside the content portlet, you simply have to add a parameter contentUri to this URL like http://host:port/irj/portal?NavigationTarget=ROLES://portal_content/folder/role/workset/page/iview&contentUri=/uri/to/the/backend/page.
