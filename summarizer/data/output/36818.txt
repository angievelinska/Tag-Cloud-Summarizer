Group

Grammar: EMPTY 

The Group element is used to specify a single constant group value within expressions, variable initializers or policies. Either 'value' or 'name' must be specified.

If you delete a group in the user administration, which you have used in the Group element of an uploaded workflow definition, its polices will fail.
