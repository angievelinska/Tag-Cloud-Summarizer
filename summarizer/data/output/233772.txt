In order to deliver your content, you have to transform it into the appropriate formats for the supported devices (e.g. HTML, WAP, PDF). In principle there are two strategies of generating the output data:

On demand
Proactive

While on-demand generation implies a longer response time for requests, proactive generation needs a considerable initial time until the output is available. But respect also that the performance of on-demand generation can be improved significantly by fine tuned caching and that proactive generation only makes sense for content which does not change too frequently. As another criterion for the right strategy you might consider access statistics to identify hotspots of your application. 

In short, it depends on the particular content application which strategy is the best, and therefore the CoreMedia CMS supports both of them. You can even combine them, e.g. pregenerate your Website up to a click-depth of three and generate the rest on demand.

For proactive generation you use the Proactive Delivery Server (PADS) API or the Proactive Engine and the HTTP Cache of the Content Application Engine (CAE).

On-demand-generation in CoreMedia CMS applications is enabled by the ADS and CAE. ADS is still unbeatable concerning performance with static content and scalability. However, if you want to create web sites using content from arbitrary sources, using a flexible caching framework, working with content objects instead of documents you are better off with CAE.

See the Delivery Developer Manuals for details of the ADS and PADS and the Content Application Developer Manual for details of the CAE.
