The client on the left hand side communicates either with a servlet container or with a stand-alone application.

When is it appropriate to use Web Services? The following list shows some requirements that suggest the use of Web Services:

One or more clients need access to a central service via network.
Different operating systems and programming languages are used at client side.
Thin clients are required.
A well known and established technology is preferred.

In contrast, the following use cases indicate, that Web Services are not a good solution for your problem:

The clients should react on events.
Large data amounts have to be transferred.
Stateful interactions between server and client are needed.
Direct references to server objects are required.
