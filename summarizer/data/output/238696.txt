 Attribute Description name Name of the explorer configuration class 

With this attribute the class used for the appearance of the explorer is chosen. Own classes must implement the interface hox.corem.editor.explorer.ExplorerFactory. As a default, the class hox.corem.editor.generic.ConfigurableExplorerFactory is used, which allows customization.

Another class which can be used is hox.corem.editor.generic.GenericExplorerFactory which shows the behavior known from CoreMedia CAP 3.2. The class is not configurable. See the API documentation for more details. extendedContextMenu Setting this attribute to "false", you can remove the menu items Check in, Check out and Revoke Check out from the context menu of the Explorer. Default is "true". combineSortingAndFiltering With this attribute set to "false", separated sorting and filtering of the documents shown in the document overview can be enabled. So it is possible, to use own Comparators with the predefined Predicates. By default, documents may be filtered and sorted in one step on the server. Remote filtering and sorting on the server is much faster than local operations which may slow down the server dramatically. So use local filtering and sorting with care. keepSelectionFocused Only use this attribute when combineSortingAndFiltering=false. If set to "true" this attribute replaces delete, insert event pairs with  contentchanged events in the ExplorerTableResourceListChain. This change allows the Explorer ResourceTable to track entry updates (which it could not when receiving delete and insert events). Therefore the focus in the document overview of the Explorer Window will not be lost. The default is "true". noLocalSortingAfterInsertAndUpdate 

Only use this attribute when combineSortingAndFiltering=false. If set to "false" this attribute will instruct the ListSorterImpl to insert (sort) new  entries rather than adding them to the end of the entry list which is the existing behaviour. Setting this property to false might imply performance degradations on editor and server, so use with care. If keepSelectionFocused is set to "true" you do not need to change the setting of noLocalSortingAfterInsertAndUpdate.

The default is "true".
