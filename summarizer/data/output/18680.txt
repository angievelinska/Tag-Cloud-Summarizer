The watchdog is installed with the server, the workflow server and the importer. The following actions can be executed with the watchdog:



Components of the CoreMedia system can be monitored for functioning.


Components can be locally stopped and/or restarted.


Depending on the state of the system, further actions can be triggered.

The watchdog is delivered in two versions:



watchdog


3* The watchdog is an independent monitoring process which is used to test regularly whether components are functioning and, in case of error, to restart them. 


probedog


3* The probedog is a process for one-time checking of the status of a component. This variant is used with integration of the CoreMedia system in a high-availability cluster. The probedog can be used as a diagnostic tool for the momentary status during operation. The probedog delivers a returncode which can be evaluated by a shell script.
