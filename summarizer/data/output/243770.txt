AutomatedTask

Grammar: ( (Variable | AggregationVariable)*, Action*, Guard?, PreCondition*, PostCondition) 

An AutomatedTask is executed automatically by the workflow engine. It performs some automated action on the Content Management Server content or on other third party systems or internal actions. The Actions of an automated task are used to customize the processing of the workflow engine. If more than one Action is provided, the actions are executed in the order in which they are specified. 

A PreCondition defines requirements which have to be fulfilled before the actions of the automated task are executed. A PostCondition defines requirements which have to be fulfilled after the action has been executed. If more than one PreCondition or PostCondition are provided, then the conditions are evaluated in the order they are defined. The result of such an evaluation operation is equivalent to specifying an 'and' expression with an ordered set of expressions. 

A Guard defines an expression, which activates and executes the task as soon as the expression evaluates to true. The expression is evaluated on state changes of process- or task instances in the Workflow-Server and content or name changes of referred resources in the Content Management Server. Note that changes to other, external entities do not trigger re-evaluation of a guard. 

A successor must be given if and only if the task is not final. 

Note: An AutomatedTask does not allow to specify Rights, Performers, and Client. This is restricted to UserTask elements which interact with the users of the CoreMedia Workflow Server.
