The Dish interface inherits from Document as well as Page and Category. Thus, the code for the navigation and the title picture should be placed in a template for Document objects. But this solution leads to another problem. A template for a dish distinguishes from a template for a category or a page object. Hence the rendering of these specialized objects should still remain in single templates. The object-oriented behaviour of the view dispatcher allows a very elegant inclusion. Just make a recursive call on the actual object with a different view name, e.g. render. Therefore you need to create at least four templates:



Document.jsp: Renders the title picture and the navigation. The rendering of the center is delegated to one of the following templates.


Dish.render.jsp: Renders a detailed dish description.


Category.render.jsp: Renders a brief list of related dish descriptions.


Page.render.jsp: Renders a brief list of dish descriptions recommended by the chef.

Think of a Dish object, for example, and you would get the following call hierarchy:
