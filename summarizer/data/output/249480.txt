How are Users Identified?

One dashboard report shows unique visitor counts. This report can only provide numbers that are as good as the algorithm to detect a user name for a request. Because the computation of a user name can be very specific to one web application, the plugin interface UserNameExtractor has been provided for this purpose. There are ready-made implementations for extracting the user name from the servlet session's principal or for assigning an artificial identifier using cookies. See chapter for a discussion of this interface and the available implementations.

By default the user is obtained from the current servlet session. While this is a standard and non-invasive identification method, many applications will require a different method.

See section "Legal Issues" of the Administration and Operations Manual for important information about possible legal implications of tracking unique visitors.
