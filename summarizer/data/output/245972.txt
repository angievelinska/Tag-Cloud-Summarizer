Editing Services contains a mechanism which allows client side browser detection. In some templates of ES this browser detection mechanism is used to load different stylesheets for different browsers. The portal integration filters this logic and so only the default stylesheets are loaded. This can be circumvent by configuring ES to detect the browser type on server side. Add the following bean in one of your configuration files in the directory WEB-INF/custom in order to enable server side browser detection:

<bean name="browserDetection_application" class="java.lang.String">
  <constructor-arg index="0" type="java.lang.String">
    <value>serverSide</value>
  </constructor-arg>
</bean>

Single Sign on should be enable for the portal context. Follow the steps described in section: Single Sign On.


The editing services controller needs to be modified. For details see: BaseUriInterceptor.
