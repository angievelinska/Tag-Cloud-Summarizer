A dynamic content data source delivers content lists that can be used as dynamic content (see section). If you want to add your own data source, you have two options:

Define your own subtype of CMDynamicList, add your own custom properties for the configuration of the dynamic content list and implement the necessary content bean classes, in particular the getItems() method.
Use the existing content type CMNamedDynamicList, which delegates the computation of the dynamic content list items to a Starter Kit plug-in. In this case, the entire configuration of the dynamic content list is typically performed by editing the contextSettings property of the CMNamedDynamicList content.

The second option will be described in the the remainder of the section.

Use CMNamedDynamicList for the data source implementation

Using the existing CMNamedDynamicList document type for the data source implementation means that you have to create or extend a Starter Kit plug-in. It consists of the following steps:
Create a class that implements the DynamicListAspect interface with two type parameters, <T> and <A extends AspectAggregator>. <T> is the type of items to return (usually page) and <A extends AspectAggregator> is the aggregator type of this aspect (usually CMNamedDynamicList).

Your aspect implementation may look as follows:
