The fifth task in the workflow is the 'CheckPublication' task, an If task. The aim of the task is to check if the publication was successfull. If it was, the workflow will be finished, otherwise the compose task will be started again.



Line 1 - 7: The If task is named 'CheckPublication'. An If task is a control flow element which will be executed automatically. 


Line 2 - 4: A condition is defined which will be evaluated. The value of the boolean variable publicationSuccessful, which has been set in the Publish task will be read using the Get element.


Line 5: If the condition evaluates to "true" (publicationSuccessful="true") the workflow should be finished. Thus the succeeding task is "Finish" task. 


Line 6: If the condition evaluates to "false" (publicationSuccessful="false") the Compose task should be offered again.
