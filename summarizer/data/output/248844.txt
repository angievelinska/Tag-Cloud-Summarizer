In the ViewDispatcher, a view can be set as the default view, which is always used when no template-ID is entered explicitly. The view name main is used here. Unlike the other views, the default view usually delivers complete HTML pages rather than HTML fragments.

In Example 4.4.1.4c, the default view is implemented so that an HTML page with a table is created. Filling of the table rows is delegated to the view renderAll. It can be seen here how a template calls another view. Instead of the call context.include(...), the command 

<jsp:include page='<%= context.getIncludeUri(document.getUri ("renderAll"))%>' flush='true'/> 

could be used. However, the various include methods are the more elegant solution.

The call of the renderAll view of the document shows polymorphism: the ViewDispatcher ensures that the correct renderAll implementation is called for each document type of the resource.
