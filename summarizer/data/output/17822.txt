After creating a group, you may continue with either adding members to groups, or assigning rules to groups. 

In order to add members to a group:
Open the group in a tab
Choose Edit | Members and users or groups that you want to add as members to your group. 

Now you may continue with assigning rules to resources:
3#
Open the group tab
Click on the [Add] button at the bottom of the window.

To assign rules to a group
Choose a resource after that a resource type (depending on your SUPERVISE rights on this resource).

If you don't have SUPERVISE rights on that resource you cannot choose a resource type. You can assign rights to a folder by choosing "Folder" in the field Resource Type.
