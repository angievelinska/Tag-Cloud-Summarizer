The order in which publications are executed depends on the assigned priority. Publications started manually in the CoreMedia Editor  are given a higher priority than importer publications or other automated publications. Publications of equal priority are queued on a first-come first-serve basis. If necessary, you can move your publication at the top of the queue (nevertheless, the current publication will not be aborted).


Proceed as follows:



Select Window|Publisher window.




The publisher window opens up.
