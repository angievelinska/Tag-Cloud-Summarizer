When a document is checked in, validators test whether certain conditions are fulfilled. At the present time, four validators are delivered with the CoreMedia Editor. These check, whether a field

is filled,
is filled with a certain pattern,
contains an integer in a specified range
A link list field can be checked for a minimal, maximal number of entries and for unique entries. In addition the allocation of a linklist field can be checked.

Another class can be used to combine several validators and one always validates to "true".

In addition own validator classes can be written. These classes implement the interface hox.corem.editor.validation.Validator2 and must be specified via the element <Validator>.
