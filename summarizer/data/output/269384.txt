After the previous section you should be acquainted with CoreMedia content types. In combination with the already introduced documents two interesting questions arise: How to access the values of a document and what kind of WebService is needed? Due to the limitations of WebServices each property type requires an own method. A document property contains either a collection or an atomic value of a particular type but you can ignore this fact to reduce the size of the Web Service interface. One solution is to just return Lists even when a single value is requested. This saves programming effort. Now the signature of your main class should be clear. Fortunately, the CoreMedia knows six property types what allows a slim web service: blobs, dates, integers, links, markups and strings. For better legibility we only show the interface here. For implementation details please refer to the  PropertiesImpl class.
