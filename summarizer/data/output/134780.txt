The CoreMedia WebEditing Server is the component which offers access to the CoreMedia repository using other tools than the CoreMedia Editor. It covers the following topics:

WebDAV access
You can access CoreMedia resources using a WebDAV enabled editor e.g. Microsoft Word.
WAGE API
You can use the WAGE API to program your own Web Clients to access the CoreMedia resources. See the CoreMedia WAGE Developer Manual for an in-depth description of this API.
CoreMedia WebEditor
The CoreMedia WebEditor is an application of the WAGE API which offers access to the CoreMedia resources using a simple browser. The look-and-feel is similar to the CoreMedia Editor.
