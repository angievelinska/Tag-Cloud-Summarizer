The control flow between the tasks can be defined by Unified Modeling Language (UML) activity diagrams using the following schemes:

Sequence

When tasks are arranged in a sequence, a successor task may start just after its predecessor task has been completed. Since the workflow server uses a pull approach, the task does not run immediately after the predecessor has been completed, as this is delayed until a user accepts it (except for automated tasks). The very first task of a process always runs immediately.
