The ActionExecutionController is a Spring MVC conforming controller which executes Actions that are passed in as request parameters. It should be used as a counterpart of the ToolbarRenderer, and the ContextMenuRenderer, but could also be used standalone. The request must also contain a target on which the action is executed. For details of the required request parameter please see the JavaDoc of the class ActionExecutionController. 

ModelAndView, NavigationHandler, and CommandPostProcessor

The controller uses the concept of NavigationHandler and CommandPostProcessor during the execution of the action. After action execution the controller returns a Spring MVC ModelAndView to the Spring Dispatcher Servlet for further processing, usually a navigation to another page. The ModelAndView is generated using the SpringMVCNavigationHandler of the action as source for the view and the SpringMVCCommandPostProcessor of the action as source for the model.
