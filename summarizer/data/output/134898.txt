The administrator can configure the CoreMedia Editor using two types of files. Property files, which are mainly used for technical concerns like the connection to the server or the logging of the editor and XML-files which are mainly used to configure the appearance of the CoreMedia Editor, e.g. which information is shown in the document overview, which buttons are shown in the toolbar or which fields are hidden in the document window. You will find a detailed description of the XML-files in the CoreMedia Editor Developer Manual.

The following property files exist:

capclient.properties
workflowclient.properties
editor.properties
proxy.properties
mime.properties
language-mapping.properties
