It may be necessary to add actions to a certain phase of the aggregation process. Predefined tasks in custom sections are available to that end. For example, the section for adding custom imports looks similar to the following fragment:

<!-- START CUSTOM SECTION: Custom Import -->
<AutomatedTask name="CustomImportStart" ...
               successor="CustomImportEnd">
  <Action class="Log" info="true" .../>
</AutomatedTask>
<!-- END CUSTOM SECTION: Custom Import -->

You can see that the single task CustomImportStart simply logs a message and exits from the custom section. It is very simple to add more actions or to split the task into a potentially large number of tasks and control flow nodes. The only important requirement is that your replacement code exits to the task CustomImportEnd in any case after synching all spawned concurrent execution branches.

While the custom sections execute, there will be no other activity in the process. Strictly speaking, the task NotifyRunning is also running, but this task simply waits for the process to end without making changes of any kind. There will not be concurrent write problems. If you decide to update not only the custom sections, but rather the entire workflow, this does not necessarily hold.

Besides CustomImportStart, also the tasks CustomConsolidationStart, CustomSnapshotStart and CustomAggregationStart are defined using a similar pattern, so that you can define imports, consolidations, snapshots and aggregations for your own data. You may maintain the dimension tables immediately after importing or immediately before consolidating, whichever is more convenient.

You can assume that certain variables are set when entering the custom sections. The following table gives details.
