Project Ideas
--------------
1. At the first login to DocMachine, a cloud with the most popular tags is displayed.
2. Have a website as a frontend, where to enter any search strings, and display my results and Tag cloud.


Project TODOs
--------------
1. - fix the warnings and errors displayed by sonar: mvn org.codehaus.sonar:sonar-maven3-plugin:2.2:sonar -DskipTests=true
   - Find Bugs
2. Skip creating the input files, parse text from DocMachine directly into a single file used for LSA.
Next step will be to parse texts from DocMachine directly into LSA.
3. move all strings from projects to properties file and load them from there
4. Research what can be done for scalabiilty and performance - should txts be parsed in a file, or used from memory?
   Research how parallelism can be implemented if txts are parsed in-memory. Describe in report.
5. discard terms that occur only once - filter termfrequency, create a filter when indexing with lucene, and exclude
terms occuring only once
6. create a test suite - a central runnable place to call all tests (or the chosen ones).
   configure a test suite for the cluster and topic identification evaluation. 


Questions
-------------
1. How to integrate indexing in Lucene with SVD in LSA? SVD uses a matrix, no indexing, no feedables.
