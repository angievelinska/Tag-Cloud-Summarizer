Tag Cloud Summarizer defines the main concepts in the documents returned as a result from search queries, and presents them as a Tag Cloud. 
Users can search in a document collection, and based on their queries a document set is returned as a result. Users can see a tag cloud representation of the documents content of the whole query result set, as well as of single documents. When a large number of documents are returned from the query, the Tag Cloud Summarizer presents a quick overview of the content found, so that users can decide instantly if they will amend the search query.
The project implements Latent Semantic Analysis in order to retrieve key concepts from the documents, and perform document indexing.
