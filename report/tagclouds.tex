\end{summary}

Tag Clouds are popular applications used for vaious purposes: as a navigation mechanism, as indicators of activity within social media experiences, for visualization in texts and textual data, for annotation of documents~\ref{fig:tagcloud}. The importance or weight of words in the tag cloud are shown with size of font and/or color. The tag clouds are hyperlinks leading to a collection of items associated with the tag.\\
A version of tag cloud is called text cloud. It is used as a visual display that conveys the broad themes that emerge from textual analysis.  
There are three types of tag clouds depeding on their purpose and use. The first type contains a tag represeting the frequency of each term. The second type is a global tag cloud whose tags has frequencies aggreggated over all items and users. The third type of tag cloud contains categories, and its tags' size indicates the number of subcategories.\\

\section{Brainstorming}
What is a tag cloud? Graphical representation of a collection of tags. Tag clouds visualize word frequency in a given text.\\

Tag clouds may be used as a topic summary.\\

There are three main types of tag cloud applications used in social software.\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item frequency of items / tags
\item number of items to which a tag has been applied
\item tags are categorization method for content items 
\end{enumerate}
The following tag clouds were evaluated in order to select the solution that is most applicable for Tag Cloud Summarizer project.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item TagsTreeMaps\footnote{\url{http://tagstreemaps.sourceforge.net/TagsTreeMaps.html}}
\item OpenCloud\footnote{\url{http://opencloud.sourceforge.net/}}
\end{itemize}
