\section{LSA implementation}
\label{sec:implementation:lsa_impl}
For the implementation of LSA this work uses the open LSA library, provided by the Natural Language Processing Group at the University of California at Berkley (UCLA)\footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/airhead-research/}}.

The real difficulty of LSA is to find out how many dimensions to remove - the problem of dimensionality.

\section{Tag Cloud implementation}
\label{sec:implementation:tag_cloud}
The implemented open source library used for tag cloud generation is called Opencloud\footnote{\url{http://opencloud.mcavallo.org/}}, and is provided by Marco Cavallo.
