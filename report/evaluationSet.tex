1 & 1 & The session that is created while the connection is opened is also known as the connection session. \\
2 & 1 & The sessions of the connected clients will be closed and no more content changes are possible. \\
3 & 1 & The previous code fragment shows how a second session is created from an existing connection. \\
4 & 1 & Multiple sessions show their greatest potential in trusted applications which receive help in restricting user views while maintaining a shared cache.  \\
5 & 1 & Having opened connection, all actions are executed on behalf of the single user whose credentials where provided when logging in. \\
\hline
6 & 2 & The state of the Master Live Server must be younger than the state of the Slave Live Server.  \\
7 & 2 & The rewrite module checks the availability of the requested file and, in the negative case, passes the request on to the Active Delivery Server. \\
8 & 2 & The directory layout of the Active Delivery Server has changed as well as the format of the configuration file. \\
9 & 2 & The CoreMedia Content Server is a central component that manages the content repository and the user authorization. \\
10 & 2 & The CoreMedia Content Management Server is the production system used to create and administrate content. \\
\hline
11 & 3 & If the database does not allow to take online-backups ensure that all publications are finished and that the last publication was successful. \\
12 & 3 & The third task in the workflow aims to check if the change set is empty. Then, no publication is necessary and the workflow can be finished.  \\
13 & 3 & This element is used to define which information should be shown in the columns of the workflow list at the left side of the workflow window. \\
14 & 3 & Publication will be executed when finishing the task after all resources in the change set have been approved. \\
15 & 3 & The CoreMedia Workflow installation comes with four predefined workflows which cover the publication of resources. \\
