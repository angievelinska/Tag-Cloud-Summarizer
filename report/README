You can use this skeleton thesis to get started with LATEX. Here are some hints:

- thesis.tex is the main file. It includes the other files. You might want to consider
  having one file per chapter.
- Add references to the references.bib file. After you update this file, first run
  LATEX, then bibtex, then LATEX again: 
  latex thesis
  bibtex thesis
  latex thesis
- If you are on Linux you can use ./makepdf.sh to create a PDF file with nice 
  fonts and graphics.
