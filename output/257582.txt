Every project has its own challenges that make it unique, but every project also has common tasks. To not reinvent the wheel over and over again, you need both, a flexible framework for the fiddly tasks, and a solid basis for the standard work. CoreMedia CMS was always known for its extensibility and flexible APIs and now CoreMedia backs this with the Starter Kit for fast project success. The Starter Kit comes with best-practice solutions for navigation, multi-language support, multi-site support and many more. If you use the standard templates, you can set up a website in less than an hour and start entering your content and design. The Starter Kit is fully customizable and allows the usage of the complete CMS 2008 framework.
