Installing the core components involves installing the core of the Social Software Extension plus the Recommendation Engine.

Proceed as follows:
Ensure that you have an installed CoreMedia CMS CAE web application template. For more information on CAE technology, see the CoreMedia CMS Administration and Operations Manual.
Copy the directory sse-webapptemplate from the coremedia-sse-<version>.zip over the web application template directory contentapplicationengine-template.
If you selected any CAE extensions to install with the CAE, you may now have duplicate libraries in contentapplication-template/WEB-INF/lib. You should check the contents of that directory for any duplicate JAR files. The ones installed with the CAE do not carry a version number while the ones from the SSE archive do. Of those JAR files which exist both with and without a version number, delete the copies without the version number as their versions are always equal to or lower than the other ones.
Configure the components as described in Section.

In addition to the files necessary to run the Social Software Extension, supplied files include a Spring view resolver, a handler mapping and a simple controller (rootController) configured in the WEB-INF/spring/sse* directories (in order to present a basic start page).

Note that you may install the Recommendation Engine in other web applications, but must then ensure that the analysis is not started concurrently in different web applications.
