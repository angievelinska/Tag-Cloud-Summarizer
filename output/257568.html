<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>There is something new in the air, editorial content produced and distributed not only with your classical content management system, but additionally by anyone out there on the net. This is the meaning of Web 2.0 - web-users participate. But not only web-users, also users in an intranet or extranet </p><p>What is special about this? All Web 2.0 sites have in common, that the user brings in value by rating or voting or adding user generated content, thus interacting in a new social way. In order to attract those people, you need to extend your site by social software functionality. CoreMedia therefore developed the <em>Social Software Extension</em>. This new component adds Web 2.0 functionality to <em>CoreMedia CMS.</em></p></div>
