There are two different strategies that can be used for approval. The default is that a history of approvals is kept (HistoryApprovalStrategy), so every approval made can later be viewed. The ReplacingApprovalStrategy always replaces the current approval. Internally, all previous approvals would be deleted.

You can change the approval strategy to the one keeping only one approval by adding the following to a custom spring configuration file like WEB-INF/spring/sse-editor/editor-services.xml:

  <bean id="approvalStrategy" 
  class="com.coremedia.sse.base.commands.strategies.
         ReplacingApprovalStrategy">
    <property name="baseModule" ref="baseModule"/>
  </bean>
