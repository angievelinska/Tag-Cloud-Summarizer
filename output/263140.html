<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>In the supplied standard set-up, users of the <em>Management Views</em>, such as editors and administrators, are authenticated against a <em>CMS Content Server</em> repository via a Unified API Connection.</p><p>The default configuration expects the Content Server IOR to be available at <span class="inlineformat--code">http://localhost:44441/coremedia/ior</span>. </p><p>Edit the <span class="inlineformat--code">objectserver.properties</span> file in the <span class="inlineformat--code">WEB-INF/spring</span> directory and set appropriate values for the IOR URL, connection username (only the system user "webserver" is allowed) and connection password. You will probably also want to change the default configuration of the <span class="inlineformat--code">management.jmxremote.url</span>. </p><p>Note that by setting up this connection, the content approval view is accessible to users which are either member of the predefined <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS </span>group "<span class="inlineformat--code">administratoren</span>" or  "<span class="inlineformat--code">editor</span>" on the content server concerned (these groups correspond to the administrators group and general editors group, respectively). This functionality can be changed if desired. The access control is defined by setting the property <span class="inlineformat--code">accessAllowedPredicate</span> for a specific view.</p><p>Access control to single views is configured in each view's Spring bean definition. The view definitions can be configured in the file <span class="inlineformat--code">editor-managementviews.xml</span>, located in the <em><span class="inlineformat--code">/spring/sse-editor</span></em> directory. </p><p>You can also change configuration to use the Social Software repository itself with its build in user management. See <a xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/261230" xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple">section</a> for more details about configuration of user providers.Users still have to be members of groups with configured names, the difference being that users and groups are stored and authenticated against the <em>Social Software</em> repository.</p><p>Please refer to the beandoc for further reference. Look for the customizers of the <span class="inlineformat--code">navigableItems</span> bean (<span class="inlineformat--code">defaultManagementViewsCustomizer</span> and <span class="inlineformat--code">extendedManagementViewsCustomizer</span>) which list the beans handling the separate views.</p></div>
