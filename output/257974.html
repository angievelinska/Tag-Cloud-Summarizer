<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Next to the innovative new features of <em>CoreMedia CMS 2008,</em> such as <em>Social Software Extension</em> or <em>StarterKit,</em> CoreMedia also cared about the maturity of existing functionalities. The storage of BLOBS by the <em>Content Server</em> is now much more versatile to meet the needs of e.g video dominated websites. BLOBs can now be dispatched to different database tables or to the file system. You can configure this behavior through metadata of the BLOB such as size, mime type or document type.</p><p>Customers asked for a possibility to use the <em>CAE Feeder</em> with other search engines than the delivered one. Thus we extended the API which enables you to connect the <em>CAE Feeder</em> with arbitrary search engines.</p><p><em>Editing Services for JSF</em> now offers an extension which analyzes the document types definition and builds corresponding editing forms from it. You can use these forms as a starting point for your own editing applications.</p><p>The Unified API has been adapted to the new Java 5 language features like generics and enumeration types. This leads to a safer and more convenient API programming style. The migration of existing Unified API applications is simple, because all calls to API methods remain source compatible.</p><p>Last but not least, CoreMedia introduced the so-called contributions. With this, several tools and helpers are provided which amend our product and help you in your daily work. They come "as is" without any warranty or support but under a permissive open source license. Feel free to improve or change it to your needs and participate by donating your own.    </p><p/></div>
