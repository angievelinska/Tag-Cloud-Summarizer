The Social Software Repository is the core database storage component of the CoreMedia SSE and its database connection must be configured in the file sse.properties, located in the spring/sse directory.

The default configuration for the Social Software Repository is as given in the listing below.

sse.repository.connection.driver_class=org.postgresql.Driver
sse.repository.connection.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sse
sse.repository.connection.username=sse
sse.repository.connection.password=sse
sse.repository.database.type=postgresql

The database must be one of the supported databases given in the Prerequisites chapter above. The appropriate value to use for the database type in the sse.properties file can be taken from the table below:
