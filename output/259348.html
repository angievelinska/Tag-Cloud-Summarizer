<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>hOn the left-hand side of this picture, you can see the resource types supporting the storage of user generated content. The type <span class="inlineformat--code">UserContent</span> is the abstract base class with the central properties <span class="inlineformat--code">title</span> and <span class="inlineformat--code">text</span>. These properties may hold the caption and the body of the text some user has submitted, respectively. In contrast to the title property, which is a plain string, the text property may contain structured XML text. </p><p>The concrete XML schema for the text property is left open here, it must be defined by concrete subclasses. The two concrete subtypes provided by the base module, RichTextUserContent and XhtmlUserContent, define <span class="inlineformat--code">coremedia-richtext-1.0</span> and <span class="inlineformat--code">xhtml-1.0</span>, respectively. You will have to define your own sublcass if you want to use a different XML schema (How to register custom schemas is described in <a xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/271358" xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple">section</a>).</p><p>If the user who has submitted the content - the "author" - is somehow "logged in" and therefore known to the system, that user is normally represented by a <span class="inlineformat--code">User</span> resource within the SSE repository. In that case, the UserContent resource is associated with that User via the Ownership relationship. The author is said to own the <span class="inlineformat--code">UserContent</span> resource. Therefore, <span class="inlineformat--code">Ownership</span> is a generalization of the author relationship, which is useful in other contexts as well. The owner of a Manageable resource will always be able to change the ACL entries for this resource, this right can never be retracted.</p><p>For the case that the author of some user content is not represented within the system, there are properties of <span class="inlineformat--code">UserContent</span> which may at least some hold basic information about the author such as a name and an e-mail address. This is to support anonymous commenting on a web site. An author not authenticated to the system will usually have to fill out at least two form fields corresponding to this information, and maybe an address field also.</p><p>A <span class="inlineformat--code">UserContent</span> resource might also be attached with one or more <span class="inlineformat--code">Media</span> resources via the <span class="inlineformat--code">Attachment</span> relationship. These may hold additional data such as pictures or videos. The <span class="inlineformat--code">data</span> property is of type <span class="inlineformat--code">Blob</span> and holds the binary data as well as the MIME type. If Media resources are attached with UserContent objects, their life cycle is intended to be the same as that of the user content resource. That is, if the user content resource is deleted, the attached media resources should be deleted as well. </p><p>On the right-hand side of the above picture are depicted the resource types intended for user and user profile management. User and Group resources are generalized to the Subject resource type. Each subject has a name which must be unique within the repository. Subjects (and, therefore, both users and groups) might be associated with arbitrary profile information, organized into resources of type <span class="inlineformat--code">ProfileCard</span>. </p><p>There are two profile card types predefined within the base module: a <span class="inlineformat--code">VCard</span> type for the usual personal and contact information of a person or organization, representing something like a business card, and a <span class="inlineformat--code">PasswordCard</span> type. The latter is intended to store password information for a user if authentication is to be done with the simple name/password authentication strategy shipped with the SSE (see the next section for more information on user providers and authentication strategies). For other profile data specific to your application, you may extend the <span class="inlineformat--code">ProfileCard</span> type with your own subtype and define the properties you need.</p><p>The <span class="inlineformat--code">ProfileDetail</span> relationship connects subjects with their profile data. Since the cardinality on the profile card side of this relationship is not constrained, there might exist arbitrary many profile cards for a given subject, even of the same <span class="inlineformat--code">ProfileCard</span> type. Keep this in mind when working with profile data. If it makes sense and the application allows to store multiple profile cards of the same type, there is usually also a special card property defined which discriminates between the different cards of a given subject, so that the application knows what card is used in which context. For vcards, the <span class="inlineformat--code">organization</span> property may take this part, so that a user may have different vcards, one for each different organization.</p><p>This completes our brief discussion of the resource type overview given in the above picture. The following picture now provides a closer look at the relationship types which connect resources of the types discussed so far:</p><p/></div>
