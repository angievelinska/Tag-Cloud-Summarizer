All user profile data and all User Generated Content (UGC) is kept in a dedicated database. SSE comes with a management interface for easy user and content management. The <em>Social Software Extension</em> is shipped with a powerful API that you can use to access the content in the database. The <em>Recommendation Engine</em> is the place, where the magic occurs. It determines so-called neighborhoods between users, that is, which user is similar to another user? From these neighborhoods, the engine calculates recommendations. The <em>Social Software Extension</em> can be easily deployed and used with the <em>StarterKit</em>.</p><p class="p--heading-2">Benefits:</p><ul><li>Easy adding of Web 2.0 functionality to websites</li><li>Fast delivery of user generated content</li><li>Editorial control of publications</li><li>Personalization by collaborative filtering </li><li>Seamless integration with other CoreMedia CMS components</li></ul><p class="p--heading-2">Main Features:</p><ul><li>Separate storage and management of user content</li><li>User profile management</li><li>Filtering/removal of offending posts with management interface</li><li>Rating, voting, tagging and commenting functionality</li><li>Extensible content model</li><li><em>Recommendation Engine</em> featuring out-of-the-box recommendation algorithms and the option to implement custom ones</li><li>RSS-/Atom-Feeds</li><li>Enterprise search integration of UGC</li><li>Comprehensive API to access the UGC</li></ul><p class="p--heading-2">Further Reading:</p><ul><li>Read the <em>CoreMedia Social Software Manual</em> for a comprehensive description of <em>CoreMedia Social Software</em>.</li><li><p>See <a xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://blog.coremedia.com" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">http://blog.coremedia.com</a> for an implementation of the <em>CoreMedia Social Software</em>.</p><p/></li></ul><p/></div>
