SeekAndWork commands can be divided into two parts: 

The first handles the collection (seeking) of resources and relationships.
The second part is working on the collected resources. 

A composite command SeekAndWorkOnElementsCommand exists which allows both parts to work within the same transaction. The SeekAndWorkOnElementsCommand could be used in conjunction with the ElementWorker. Collector commands should implement the AbstractElementCollectorCommand, worker commands the AbstractElementWorkerCommand.

The following default implementations exist: 

The ElementCollectorCommand, which uses CascadingRules for collecting Elements.
The DestroyElementsCommand, destroys the collected Elements from the database.
