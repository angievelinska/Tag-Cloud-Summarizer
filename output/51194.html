This includes databases, hardware, operating systems, drivers, virtual machines, class libraries, customized code etc. in many different combinations. That's why we need detailed information about the environment for a support case. In order to track down your problem, we need:</p><ul><li>Which CoreMedia component(s) did the problem occur with (incl. release number)?</li><li>Which database is in use (version, drivers)?</li><li>Which operating system(s) is/are in use?</li><li><p>Which Java environment is in use?</p></li><li><p>Which customizations have been implemented?</p></li><li>a full description of the problem (as detailed as possible)</li><li>Can the error be reproduced? If yes, give a description please.</li><li>How are the security settings (firewall)?</li></ul><p>In addition, log files are the most valuable source of information.</p></div>
