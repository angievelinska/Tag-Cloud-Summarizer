A general start of CoreMedia SSE requires starting the Tomcat web application container. Once the container has started, you can test the system integrity by opening the URL given in the listing below, replacing <server> and <port> with the appropriate values for your system.

http://<servername>:<port>/sse-editor/servlet/console

On accessing this URL, a Management Views login dialog is shown.

You can now test the login process using a CMS administrator login (assuming this configuration has been retained as set up in the standard system).

If the login process displays no errors, then the system has been started correctly.
