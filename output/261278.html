<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Configuring the <em>Social Software Feeder</em> involves first of all configuration of a <em>CAE Feeder</em>. While the <em>Social Software Feeder</em> re-uses the same database and therefore requires no database connection of its own to be defined, you do however need to further configure the feeding of content from the <em>Social Software Repository</em> to a search engine in order to enable full-text search.</p><p>To proceed, ensure that you have already set up the <em>CAE Feeder</em> with a database connection. For further information, consult the <em>CMS Administration Manual</em> on configuring the <em>CAE Feeder.</em></p><p>First, it should be noted that while the <em>CAE Feeder</em> can feed content to any kind of search engine, this scenario is likely to require the implementation of your own adapter, called an <span class="inlineformat--code">Indexer</span>, which would then handle the items fed to it. This section therefore only deals with the standard supplier adapter, for the <em>Fast Enterprise</em> search engine. It therefore follows that you must also have a <em>FAST Enterprise</em> server installed in order to make use of the instructions given below. Instructions on installing this component are given in the relevant chapter of the <em>CMS Administration and Operation Manual </em>and the documentation provided by <em>FAST</em> itself.</p><p>In the standard supplied configuration, <em>CoreMedia CMS 2008</em> provides an implementation of an indexer for the <em>FAST </em>search engine supporting version 4.3 and 5.1. The <em>Social Software Extension</em> also provides an implementation that simplifies searching with the <em>FAST</em> search engine. </p><p>You configure the <em>Social Software Repository</em> by configuring the property file <span class="inlineformat--code">config/caefeeder/spring/sse/sse.properties</span> as described in <a xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/260988" xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple">section</a>.  </p><p>The document types to be indexed are configured in the file <span class="inlineformat--code">sse-feeder-triggers.xml</span>, located in the <span class="inlineformat--code">config/caefeeder/spring/sse-feeder</span> directory. The standard configuration for CoreMedia SSE content includes the <span class="inlineformat--code">User</span> and <span class="inlineformat--code">Group</span> type, based on an attached <span class="inlineformat--code">VCard</span> profile card, and the <span class="inlineformat--code">UserContent</span> type including all subtypes. </p><p>As such, this standard configuration includes content from the CMS. The configuration of your <em>CAE Feeder</em> remains untouched. Consult the <em>CoreMedia CMS Content Application Developer Manual</em> for more information about defining feeding CMS content beans.</p><p>If you do not want to index any CMS content, you need to remove some files and uncomment the bean definitions in the file <span class="inlineformat--code">config/caefeeder/spring/sse-feeder/sse-feeder-standalone.xml</span>. The following files contain references to the CMS repository and must be deleted or otherwise adapted, e.g. if you want to keep JMX support:</p><ul><li><span class="inlineformat--code">config/caefeeder/framework/cap-objectserver-uapi-config.jar</span></li><li><span class="inlineformat--code">config/caefeeder/framework/cap-proactiveengine-uapi-config.jar</span></li><li><span class="inlineformat--code">config/caefeeder/spring/*.xml</span></li></ul><p/></div>
