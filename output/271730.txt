In order to destroy deleted users including there profile cards and the genereated content you need to define no special filters, but two additional CascadingRules: profileDetailCascadingRule and ownershipCascadingRule. See section for details. And of course we need the resource type name: User. The password is expected to be defined in the property file of the tool.
