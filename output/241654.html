<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>In this chapter you will get a very high-level overview of the <em>Unified API</em> and a sketch of its possible applications.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>The <em>Unified API</em> is the preferred API for interfacing with the <em>CoreMedia CMS</em> when writing custom tools and agents and when writing content delivery applications. In particular, it is tightly integrated with the <em>CoreMedia Content Application Engine</em> and it replaces the <em>Scripting API</em>. Moreover, it is available in the <em>Workflow Server</em> for modifying content and for implementing plugin classes.</p><p>The <em>Unified API</em> allows you to access both the <em>Content Server</em> and the <em>Workflow Server</em> from custom code. It presents the properties of documents, versions, folders, users, groups, processes, and tasks in a uniform and object-oriented way.</p><p>While the <em>Unified API</em> is comprehensive, care has been taken to isolate various aspects of the API, so that each individual aspect remains of moderate size. To this end, a connection mediates between multiple repositories. In turn, each repository is augmented by services and provides access to stateful objects. Stateful objects share a common meta-model and are identified in a common name space. This style is applied throughout the API and promotes uniformity.</p><p>Typical applications of the<em> Unified API</em> are:</p><ul><li>content delivery through a servlet engine;</li><li>form-driven web applications for content modifications;</li><li>administrative command line tools;</li><li>background processes whose actions are triggered by events;</li><li>periodically scheduled processes that carry out custom actions;</li><li>workflow actions, expressions, performers policies, and rights policies.</li></ul><p/></div><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>The Unified API supports programmers and administrators in their work, leading to a significant productivity gain.</p><ul><li><em>Programming is easy.</em></li><li class="list-item--none">While the API is comprehensive, a simple application might still not use more than half a dozen classes. This greatly reduces the initial learning effort for using the API.</li><li class="list-item--none">Creating a connection to <em>Content Server</em> and <em>Workflow Server</em> is as simple as calling a single method. Afterwards, the connection provides quick access to the entire system.</li><li class="list-item--none"><p class="list-item--none">As different parts of the API share a common style and in fact a common meta-model, it is comparatively easy to acquire knowledge about new parts of the API.</p></li><li class="list-item--none"><p class="list-item--none">The API explicitly specifies pre- and postconditions and indicates the possible events and exceptions, leaving little room for ambiguities.</p></li><li class="list-item--none">Convenience methods simplify common tasks.</li><li class="list-item--none"><p class="list-item--none">Widespread Java standard are embraced. In particular, this applies to the collections API, the commons logging API, and the Java beans conventions.</p></li><li><em>Deployment is easy.</em></li><li class="list-item--none">Deploying an application that uses the <em>Unified API</em> is straightforward. Adding a few jars to the class path is all that is needed. The API does not demand special configuration files.</li><li class="list-item--none">Through a management interface it is possible to control <em>Unified API</em> applications at runtime.</li><li><em>The API is memory-efficient.</em></li><li class="list-item--none">Multiple sessions per connection are possible, sharing a common cache while providing individual rights checks.</li><li class="list-item--none">All stateful objects are thin wrappers that use little memory and fetch their state through the common cache as needed.</li><li><em>The API is robust.</em></li><li class="list-item--none">The <em>Unified API</em> can survive server restarts, providing a continuous event stream and maintaining cache consistency.</li><li class="list-item--none">The cache size is configurable in bytes, virtually eliminating fluctuations of memory usage by the API.</li></ul><p/></div><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Here we will sketch typical use cases for the <em>Unified API</em>.</p><p class="p--heading-1">Content Delivery</p><p>Situation: You want to deliver content that is stored in the <em>CoreMedia CMS</em>, e.g., when generating a web site.</p><p>Solution: The <em>Unified API</em> is used inside the <em>CoreMedia Content Application Engine</em> to access persistent data. The engine is used for efficient caching on higher levels. JSPs render your content.</p><p class="p--heading-1">Form-driven Content Modification</p><p>Situation: You want to create a web application that allows certain recurring modifications of the content, e.g., changing a price information.</p><p>Solution: Again, you use the <em>CoreMedia Content Application Engine</em>, this time augmented with the write functionality of the <em>Unified API</em>.</p><p class="p--heading-1">Command Line Tool</p><p>Situation: You want to create a command line tool that automates certain administrative tasks, e.g., the creation of users with a predefined set of query documents.</p><p>Solution: You program the tool using the <em>Unified API</em>, possibly starting with the base client provided as a code example.</p><p class="p--heading-1">Automated Agents</p><p>Situation: You want to create background processes that perform automated actions when certain events occur, e.g., starting a workflow when a document is moved into a certain folder.</p><p>Solution: You create an appropriate repository listener using the <em>Unified API</em> and add the required actions in Java code.</p><p class="p--heading-1">Workflow Actions</p><p>Situation: You want to perform very complicated actions during certain workflow tasks.</p><p>Solution: You program a workflow action using the <em>Unified API</em>, updating content objects and workflow variables as needed. You might want to create a user-specific session for modifications.</p><p class="p--heading-1">Performers Policies</p><p>Situation: You want to control the set of users to whom a certain task is offered.</p><p>Solution: You program a performers policy using the <em>Unified API</em>, evaluating the state of workflow variables and referenced content while determining one or more users who may execute the task. Possibly, you also create a right policy to limit the permissible activities of the chosen users.</p><p/></div>
