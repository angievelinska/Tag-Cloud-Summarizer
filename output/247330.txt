An increasing number of web applications and websites depend on their users to create and modify a large proportion of their content - so-called "user-generated content" (UGC) being the result. Indeed, many sites also allow their users to contribute to the existing "official" editorial content by submitting reviews, comments, additional material or categorizations, or by getting involved in other ways. The types of applications with such user involvement range from traditional websites enhanced by simple commenting mechanisms to portals basing their entire business model purely on UGC, content sharing, and user collaboration. One of the differences between traditional websites and those involving a significant amount of UGC is the greatly increased writer/reader ratio. The CoreMedia Social Software Extension (CoreMedia SSE) provides application developers with a data store and application programming interfaces (API) to support the creation of such sites as described above.
