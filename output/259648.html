<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p><em>CoreMedia SSE</em> extends applications built on top of the <em>CoreMedia Content Application Engine</em> (CAE). Storage of user-generated content and user profile data is achieved using a database schema independent of the CMS content repository. The extension has been designed from the ground up to scale gracefully, allowing high-end sites to support parallel, simultaneous content authoring by many individual contributors. High delivery throughput is guaranteed by the CAE caching infrastructure, and the user-generated content can be easily and rapidly searched via the integrated <em>CoreMedia Search Engine</em>.</p></div>
