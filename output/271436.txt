The SeekAndWork tool is customizable with the common Spring framework mechanisms. The tool consists of the following central parts:

A controller representing the HTTP interface and accepting HTTP Post calls. This controller uses an ElementWorker which does the work. The ElementWorker is pluggable, thus you may provide your own ElementWorker implementation
An ElementWorker implementation (DefaultElementWorker) which queries the repository for a defined set of resources and instantiates all required beans.
 It executes a plugable command with a defined argument (SeekAndWorkOnElementsCommandArg). The Query -created by the DefaultElementWorker- may be extended by application specific SeekFilter implementations. Some default implementations already exists, they are described below.


A set of command classes which are used for collecting resources, their relationships, and their dependent resources.



The following subsections describe the components of that architecture in more detail.
