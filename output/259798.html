In this case, you will see a message advising you to try accessing the resource later.</p><p>To complete the approval process for an item, click the appropriate <span class="inlineformat--button">Approve</span>, <span class="inlineformat--button">Reject</span> or <span class="inlineformat--button">Undecided</span> button to execute the corresponding action. </p><p>In addition, a comment can also be added to explain the action you have selected via the comment field: this is then shown to other users of the Approval View.</p></div>
