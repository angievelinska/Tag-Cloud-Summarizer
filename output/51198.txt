An essential feature for the CoreMedia system administration is the output log of Java processes and CoreMedia components. They're often the only source of information for error tracking and solving. All protocolling services should run at the highest log level that is possible in the system context. For a fast breakdown, you should be logging at debug level. The location where component log output is written is specified in it's *.properties or *.jpif startup file.

Which Log File?

Mostly at least two CoreMedia components are involved in errors. In most cases, we need the *server.log files together with the log file from the client. If you are able locate the problem exactly, solving the problem becomes much easier.

Where do I Find the Log Files?

Log files can be found in the CoreMedia component's installation directory in /var/logs. CoreMedia Active Delivery Server log files in tomcat4/webapps/coremedia/WEB-INF/var/logs.
