The Social Software Extension comes without a concrete rating or voting type because you need to differentiate between your different kind of ratings and voting. 

In order to define a rating you take the following steps:
Define a rating type
Register the rating type 
Register the rating bean

Define the rating type interface

A definition of a rating would only contain a unique name and uri and would look like this:

package com.coremedia.sse.examples.rating;
import com.coremedia.sse.core.annotations
       .RelationshipTypeAnnotation;
import com.coremedia.sse.base.model.Rating;

@RelationshipTypeAnnotation(name= StarRating.NAME,
    uri = "http://www.coremedia.com/2007/sse/types
               /starterkit/StarRating",
    parent = Rating.class,
    isAbstract = false)
public interface StarRating extends Rating {
  final static String NAME = "StarRating";
}

Register the rating type interface

Register the type in your configuration file in the  /spring directory. You need one property customizer for defining all your resource types and one for your relationship types.

<customize:append id="baseModuleRelationshipTypesConfig" 
bean="sseRelationshipTypes">
      <list>
         <value>com.coremedia.sse.examples.StarRating</value>
<!-- add more of your customized relationship types here -->
      </list>
</customize:append>

Register the rating type bean

There is no need for your own implementation, since the StarRating does not require an additional property. It is sufficient to use the RatingImpl. But you still need to configure which bean implementation should be used in your configuration file:

<bean name="sseBeanFactory:Friendship"
        scope="prototype"  
        class="com.coremedia.sse.base.elementbeans.RatingImpl¿
        parent=¿abstractBaseModuleBean"/>
