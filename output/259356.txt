After having successfully indexed your content, the next step is to search for keywords in your application. You can use the FastSearchEngine bean to easily use the full text search feature. The bean is defined as searchEngine and can be used to easily search for keywords. It provides some basic methods for searching, e.g. you can search for Users using one of the following methods:


List<User> findUsers(String query)

List<User> findUsers(String query, List<OrderEntry> orderEntries, 
int offSet, int numberOfResults);



The first method allows you to search for simple search terms, for example "president" and only return users, who have the word "president" somewhere as property in their profile card. The more advanced second method has some additional parameters for sorting a search result and for restricting the number of search results. The same kind of methods exist for searching for UserContent.


List<UserContent> findUserContent(String query)

List<UserContent> findUserContent(String query, 
List<OrderEntry> orderEntries, int offSet, 
int numberOfResults);



If you do not want to restrict your search to one document type or you have your own type indexed (don't forget, you need to define your own FeedablePopulator for that), you can use more general search method:

List findUserContent(String type, String query, 
List<OrderEntry> orderEntries, int offSet, 
int numberOfResults);


If you do not want to restrict the search to one type, you can use null as parameter value. The result always returns beans generated by the id provider.
