<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>As you can see, there are a couple of relationship types which make use of the possibility to attach properties not only to resources, but to relationships as well.  Among these are the relationship types <span class="inlineformat--code">Tagging</span>, <span class="inlineformat--code">Rating</span> and <span class="inlineformat--code">Voting</span>, which together are modeled to be some kind of <span class="inlineformat--code">Classification</span> of a resource. </p><p>A <span class="inlineformat--code">Classification</span> connects a user who is the creator of the given classification with the target resource which is classified this way. Since a <span class="inlineformat--code">Tagging</span> inherits all properties from the <span class="inlineformat--code">Element</span> base type, there is a creation date associated with every classification. This property might be used in queries to filter for classifications done in a particular time window. Tag clouds which show the most frequenty used tags within the last month are typical examples.</p><p>A <span class="inlineformat--code">Tagging</span> carries the tag which the user has chosen to label the resource with. There might be several tagging instances with the same target resource, each one carrying a different user but the same tag. </p><p>A <span class="inlineformat--code">Rating</span> is a kind of assessment a user makes about a resource in terms of quality or quantity. It carries a double value which encodes the assessment, typically within some application dependant, continuous range. <span class="inlineformat--code">Rating</span> is an abstract type, application programmers will have to define a concrete subtype for a specific rating domain.</p><p class="align--none">A <span class="inlineformat--code">Voting</span> represents a interest or opinion a user expresses about a resource. There are typically multiple choices from which the user may choose from, although this is not required. There might be just a single choice for a concrete voting type such as "thumbs up", for example. The <span class="inlineformat--code">choice </span>property of a <span class="inlineformat--code">Voting</span> encodes the choice made by the user. In contrast to a ratings value, this is an integer property, reflecting the discrete nature of multiple choice questions. Similar to <span class="inlineformat--code">Rating</span>, <span class="inlineformat--code">Voting</span> is an abstract type. A concrete subtype has to be defined for a specific voting application. </p><p class="align--none">There are two concrete voting types predefined in the base module: <span class="inlineformat--code">Complaint</span> and <span class="inlineformat--code">Approval</span>. A <span class="inlineformat--code">Complaint</span> is issued by a user who discovered some kind of inappropriate content. This vote might then be exploited by some editor who is authorized to revise or delete the content. An <span class="inlineformat--code">Approval </span>is used by the management views shipped with CoreMedia SSE where you may require a dedicated approval step by some authorized editor before a submitted user generated content might be allowed to occur on a public website.</p><p>Typically, classifications are applied to resources of type <span class="inlineformat--code">UserContent</span>. But since the resource type of the <span class="inlineformat--code">target</span> role of <span class="inlineformat--code">Classification</span> is the general type <span class="inlineformat--code">Resource</span>, even users or  groups might be tagged, rated or voted upon. And, since an external content object is represented within the SSE repository as an instance of an <span class="inlineformat--code">ExternalReference </span>resource, it is possible to classify external content as well.</p></div>
