The Social Software Extension (SSE) builds on the well-known Content Application Engine, which integrates editorial content with user generated content (UGC). All user profile data and all User Generated Content (UGC) is kept in a dedicated database. SSE comes with a management interface for easy user and content management. The Social Software Extension is shipped with a powerful API that you can use to access the content in the database. The Recommendation Engine is the place, where the magic occurs. It determines so-called neighborhoods between users, that is, which user is similar to another user? From these neighborhoods, the engine calculates recommendations. The Social Software Extension can be easily deployed and used with the StarterKit.
