Default "userProvider" and "namePasswordVerifier" beans are configured in sse-authentication.xml. If required, each of these may be replaced in a custom configuration file. See spring/sse/sse-authentication-example.xml for sample declarations of the different NamePasswordVerifier implementations.

A custom UserProvider implementation may be useful to integrate external authentication systems which require credentials other than a name and a password, to customize the #createUser implementation (e.g. to create certain profile cards with information about the user identity in the external system), or to add custom Principals to the Subject returned by #getSubject.
