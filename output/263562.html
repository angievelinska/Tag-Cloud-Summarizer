The default is that a history of approvals is kept (HistoryApprovalStrategy), so every approval made can later be viewed. The ReplacingApprovalStrategy always replaces the current approval. Internally, all previous approvals would be deleted.</p><p>You can change the approval strategy to the one keeping only one approval by adding the following to a custom spring configuration file like <span class="inlineformat--code">WEB-INF/spring/sse-editor/editor-services.xml</span><em>:</em></p><p class="p--codeblock"><em>  &lt;bean id="approvalStrategy" </em><br/>  <em>class="com.coremedia.sse.base.commands.strategies.</em><br/>         <em>ReplacingApprovalStrategy"&gt;</em><br/><em>    &lt;property name="baseModule" ref="baseModule"/&gt;</em><br/><em>  &lt;/bean&gt;</em></p></div>
