Management Views

Management views enable the editorial staff to work with user generated content from within their editing environment, i.e. without having to access the end-user website. Currently, two major use cases are supported by the management views web application:

user account managment, including activation and deactivation of users, browsing user and group profile information, and managing group memberships


a simple and efficient way to approve or disapprove incoming user generated content, before it will be published on the website, if this is what the application policy requires
