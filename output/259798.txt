The approval process has three possible outcomes:

A comment may be approved, meaning that it can be viewed on the publicly-accessible section of your site
A comment may be rejected, meaning that it is not shown
A comment may be marked as undecided, meaning that it is then offered to other editors for consideration

Note: any comment shown in your approval view is, as standard, locked for 30 seconds. After this time, other users are free to approve the item. If you cannot access an item you are currently searching for, it may happen because it is already locked for 30 seconds for another editor. In this case, you will see a message advising you to try accessing the resource later.

To complete the approval process for an item, click the appropriate Approve, Reject or Undecided button to execute the corresponding action. 

In addition, a comment can also be added to explain the action you have selected via the comment field: this is then shown to other users of the Approval View.
