Aside from the database configuration, the Recommendation Engine also requires a number of other properties to be configured.

These are described below.

Relation Properties

The properties shown below configure the relation used in the data analysis.

recommend.flow.source.relation=
recommend.flow.source.property=

These properties must be configured, otherwise any analysis will abort immediately without computing recommendations. 

As can be seen from the property definitions below, the properties do not have default values: the exact values that you need to enter here are project-specific and therefore require input from your development team.
