<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Installing the core components involves installing the core of the <em>Social Software Extension</em> plus the <em>Recommendation Engine</em>.</p><p>Proceed as follows:</p><ol><li>Ensure that you have an installed <em>CoreMedia CMS CAE</em> web application template. For more information on CAE technology, see the <em>CoreMedia CMS Administration and Operations Manual</em>.</li><li>Copy the directory <span class="inlineformat--code">sse-webapptemplate</span> from the <span class="inlineformat--code">coremedia-sse-&lt;version&gt;.zip</span> over the web application template directory <span class="inlineformat--code">contentapplicationengine-template</span>.</li><li>If you selected any CAE extensions to install with the CAE, you may now have duplicate libraries in <span class="inlineformat--code">contentapplication-template/WEB-INF/lib</span>. You should check the contents of that directory for any duplicate JAR files. The ones installed with the CAE do not carry a version number while the ones from the SSE archive do. Of those JAR files which exist both with and without a version number, delete the copies <strong>without</strong> the version number as their versions are always equal to or lower than the other ones.</li><li>Configure the components as described in <a xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/260984" xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple">Section</a>.</li></ol><p>In addition to the files necessary to run the <em>Social Software Extension</em>, supplied files include a Spring view resolver, a handler mapping and a simple controller (<span class="inlineformat--code">rootController</span>) configured in the <span class="inlineformat--code">WEB-INF/spring/sse*</span> directories (in order to present a basic start page).</p><p>Note that you may install the <em>Recommendation Engine</em> in other web applications, but must then ensure that the analysis is not started concurrently in different web applications.</p></div>
