The Recommendation Engine requires a database. This database may be hosted on the same server (or within the same schema) as the Social Software Repository database. This is the default scenario for the batch process part of the Recommendation Engine. 

Alternatively, an entirely separate database system (schema) may also be used, in order to accommodate higher load and/or varying security arrangements or requirements. 

As has been noted above, the two parts of the Recommendation Engine perform different tasks and therefore require different configuration tasks to be completed. In particular, the service part of the Recommendation Engine may need to read from a replicated snapshot in order to reduce load on the live database.

The chapters below cover database configuration requirements for both parts.

Batch Process Configuration

Database configuration for the batch process part of the Recommendation Engine is done in the sse-flows.properties file, located in the spring/sse-flows directory. The batch process part stores likeness results and recommendations to this database.

The configuration may be kept the same as that of the Social Software Repository, as noted above. In this case, the relevant configuration information from the sse.properties file merely needs to be copied into the relevant fields in the sse-flows.properties file. Otherwise, enter new configuration information to store the data elsewhere. 

The relevant portion of the sse-flows.properties file is shown below with the database configuration completed with sample values. All database-related properties have identical semantics to the database properties for the repository as discussed in section.

recommend.flow.connection.driver_class=org.postgresql.Driver
recommend.flow.connection.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sse
recommend.flow.connection.username=sse
recommend.flow.connection.password=sse
recommend.flow.database.type=postgresql

Service Configuration

The configuration of the service part of the Recommendation Engine must match the configuration of the batch process part of the component. 

Configuration of the service is done in the sse.properties file (located in the spring/sse directory), not in the sse-flows.properties file.

A sample configuration is given below. Note that the database type is not given.

# Recommendation Engine: service part database connection
# This connection configuration must match the Recommendation 
# Engine batch process configuration.
# It is used to read recommendation engine results.
recommend.service.connection.driver_class=org.postgresql.Driver
recommend.service.connection.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sse
recommend.service.connection.username=sse
recommend.service.connection.password=sse
