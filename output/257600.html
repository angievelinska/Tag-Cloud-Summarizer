<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Wouldn't it be nice to combine the features for your content applications from a library of pre-fabricated Plug-Ins? Newsletter, Imagemaps, Tagclouds - plugging together what you need to make it special and stunning with the least effort - that is the vision. Maybe you can buy a Plug-In from a CoreMedia partner, who already solved your requirement before, or reuse one you developed once in a project or even if there is no plug-in for your custom functionality yet, at least an clear modular development concept for your project would be desirable.</p><p>With the "Modular Configuration" CoreMedia get's closer to this vision. To offer you a flexible content management system which you can easily extend, CoreMedia improved the way of configuring &amp; structuring web applications in the <em>Content Application Engine</em> and the whole CMS.</p><p/></div>
