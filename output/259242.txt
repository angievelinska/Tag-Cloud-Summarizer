It is also possible to define a subset of possible Hibernate configuration properties in the sse.properties file. Note, however, that properties likely to cause unintended repository behavior are overwritten by the system.

Improving PostgreSQL performance

In order to improve the performance of a PostgreSQL database you have to change the default value of the default_statistics_target property located in the postgresql.conf file in the data/ directory of your PostgreSQL installation. This property sets the default statistics target for table columns that have not had a column-specific target set via the ALTER TABLE SET STATISTICS. A larger value increases the time needed to execute ANALYZE, but might improve the quality of the planner's estimates. That will in turn reduce the number of full table scans.
Change the setting of default_statistics_target to a value >> 10. Try 500 for a start.
You do not have to restart the database after the change. Execute

<PostgreSQLInstDir>/binpg_ctl.exe reload -D <DataDir> 
or
Click Reload Configuration in the Windows PostgreSQL menu.
3#
Execute ANALYZE in the SQL-console. You should run ANALYZE on a regular basis, once a night for example.
