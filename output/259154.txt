With the RSS/Atom feed generation API in package com.coremedia.feeds, you can easily add RSS 2.0 and/or Atom 1.0 feeds to your application in a convenient and CAE-friendly way. In the current release of the Social Software Extension, com.coremedia.feeds is implemented as a thin layer on top of the open source library ROME. In addition to the functionality provided by ROME, the feed generation API has the following features:

FeedGeneratorImpl creates feeds from arbitrary lists of beans (including instances of ContentBean and ElementBean), as long as a FeedItemDataProvider for the bean is configured.
FeedGeneratorImpl can easily be created and configured as a singleton in a Spring application context,
the strategy to create a feed entry from a bean is encapsulated by FeedItemDataProviders,
custom FeedItemDataProviders may be added to an application in order to support additional custom bean types
