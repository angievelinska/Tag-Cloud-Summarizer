<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>The <em>Social Software Extension</em> (SSE) consists of the <em>SSE</em> client library and several additional components, which are built on top of this client library and integrate the <em>SSE</em> managed content with other parts of the content management infrastructure. All of these components access a shared database, the Social Software repository, containing the user generated content, user account information, and metadata. In the following it is refered to the Social Software repository simply as the "repository", unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p><p>Applications exposing <em>SSE</em> functionality to end users will include the client library and access the repository via its API, which is described in the remainder of this chapter.</p></div>
