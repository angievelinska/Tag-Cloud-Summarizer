<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>You can use the SeekAndWork tool to "work" on a defined set of Resources including dependent resources. The tool consists of two parts: First, a HTTP Interface which is integrated into the SSE Management Views, and second command line tools which are using this interface.</p><p>The HTTP Interface consists of a Spring Controller and a couple of Spring beans which are described below. The command line is not part of the Management Views, but could be installed with a <span class="inlineformat--coremediaCAE">CAE</span> Feeder, or <span class="inlineformat--contentmanageserver">Content Server</span>. The SeekAndWork tool needs a specific "worker" defined; you might want  to develop your own worker, or using the default implementation (<span class="inlineformat--code">DefaultElementWorker</span>) with a custom spring configuration.</p></div>
