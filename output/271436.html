<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>The SeekAndWork tool is customizable with the common Spring framework mechanisms. The tool consists of the following central parts:</p><ul><li>A controller representing the HTTP interface and accepting HTTP Post calls. This controller uses an <span class="inlineformat--code">ElementWorker</span> which does the work. The <span class="inlineformat--code">ElementWorker</span> is pluggable, thus you may provide your own <span class="inlineformat--code">ElementWorker</span> implementation</li><li>An <span class="inlineformat--code">ElementWorker</span> implementation (<span class="inlineformat--code">DefaultElementWorker</span>) which queries the repository for a defined set of resources and instantiates all required beans.</li><li> It executes a plugable command with a defined argument (<span class="inlineformat--code">SeekAndWorkOnElementsCommandArg</span>). The Query -created by the <span class="inlineformat--code">DefaultElementWorke</span>r- may be extended by application specific <span class="inlineformat--code">SeekFilter</span> implementations. Some default implementations already exists, they are described below.</li><li><p>A set of command classes which are used for collecting resources, their relationships, and their dependent resources.</p><p/></li></ul><p>The following subsections describe the components of that architecture in more detail.</p></div>
