The following steps are necessary to deploy the Social Software Extension Core or the Management Views into IBM Websphere Application Server:



configure Websphere as stated in the Websphere Administration/Operation Manual (14.5 Deployment to IBM WebSphere)


remove the c3p0-9.1.jar from WEB-INF/lib 


Patch sse.properties (/spring/sse/sse.properties) in coremedia-sse-core-config.jar (WEB-INF/lib)


remove hibernate.c3p0.* entries from the property-file (so Hibernate does not use C3P0).

(This change cannot be done by customization of properties, as the properties must not be defined at all!)
