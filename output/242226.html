<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>According to the underlying content model the <em>CoreMedia Editor</em> generates forms for resource editing. The default forms provide editing facilities for each property of a document (so called property editors), general editing functionality like copy&amp;paste and <span class="inlineformat--sctproduct">CoreMedia CMS</span> version control features (see User Manual, Basic Knowledge). You can control the layout and behavior of these forms concerning the following aspects:</p><ul><li>use special property editors (e.g. a string editor which automatically converts to upper case. CoreMedia provides some alternative property editors to use, but you can also implement your own.)</li><li>initialize and validate input (e.g. make sure that an integer value is greater than 42)</li><li>provide complex commands (e.g. create a new document and link it into some navigational structure)</li></ul><p>Furthermore you can control </p><ul><li>localization</li><li>language specific spell checking</li><li>rich text formatting</li><li>filters to hide some objects from the users (e.g. document types they are not supposed to instantiate or folders that do not concern them)</li><li>renderers to display objects (e.g. the fields in the document table)</li></ul><p>Many Editor features can be achieved or controlled simply by configuration, without writing a single line of code. However, understanding all the possibilities requires some knowledge of Java. </p><p>See the <em>Editor Developer Manual</em> for details.</p></div>
