The main job of the ElementCollectorCommand is to collect resources and relationships. It uses CascadingRules to collect dependent resources of the set of resources given with the SeekAndWorkOnElementsCommandArg. It looks -recursivly- at all relationships and dependent resources and adds those resources and relations which matches the defined ResourceTypes and RelationShipTypes of the CascadingRule. You can find a detailed description of the algorithm used to collect the elements in the JavaDoc of the ElementCollectorCommand.
