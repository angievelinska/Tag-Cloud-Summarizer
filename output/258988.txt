Recommendation Engine

An application allowing end-users to express their opinion via ratings may take advantage of the large amount of opinions accumulated over time. Using appropriate algorithms, an application can derive properties of users or content, which emerge from entire set of collected data. Typically, these algorithms operate on a large amount of data and take some time to run to completion. The SSE recommendation engine provides a framework and a runtime component for the execution of such algorithms.

Generally speaking, the recommendation engine repeatedly runs a one or more batch jobs to process data available in the repository (the source database) and writes the result to a target database. During the execution of a job, the results of the last run remain available in the target database. After completion, the previous results are replaced with the newer ones.

In this release, the SSE recommendation engine includes an implementation of algorithms to derive the following information from data in the repository:

user similarities based on user ratings,
item similarities based on user ratings,
item recommendations for a specific user, based on this user's ratings and similar users' rating.

The results of these computations are made available to applications via the RecommendationService, which is part of the SSE API.

While the source and target database may be the same, i.e. the recommendation engine results reside in the same database schema as the SSE repository, different setups are possible as well. The target database may be separate from the Social Software repository and the recommendation service may be configured to read the results from this different data source.
