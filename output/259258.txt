Approval Tab customization

The approval process single item page is structured into three compartments: 

the left compartment displays information on the item's author, 
the right compartment holds the approval controls 
and the middle section displays the single item which is to be approved. 

You can customize the middle view to the project's need. The editor template is called UserContent.approvalDetail.jsp and belongs to the template package com.coremedia.sse.base.model.

User Content Tab

It is just as well possible for you to customize the look of the items' appearance in the search result and approval history lists: This template is called UserContent.approvalOverview.jsp in the same package.
