Wouldn't it be nice to combine the features for your content applications from a library of pre-fabricated Plug-Ins? Newsletter, Imagemaps, Tagclouds - plugging together what you need to make it special and stunning with the least effort - that is the vision. Maybe you can buy a Plug-In from a CoreMedia partner, who already solved your requirement before, or reuse one you developed once in a project or even if there is no plug-in for your custom functionality yet, at least an clear modular development concept for your project would be desirable.

With the "Modular Configuration" CoreMedia get's closer to this vision. To offer you a flexible content management system which you can easily extend, CoreMedia improved the way of configuring & structuring web applications in the Content Application Engine and the whole CMS.
