To search for user-generated content items, go to the User Content tab. This presents you with a view similar to the screenshot shown below. To limit your search, add a search term to the text field and press <Return>.

You can select the approval status of the user-generated content you are searching for in the drop down on the right of the search text field. E.g., you can restrict your search to user-generated content items currently not having any approval status ("not processed" in the screenshot below).

You can further select the order in which the results should be displayed ("oldest first" or "newest first"). If all the results of your search for user-generated content items cannot be displayed on the same page, you can navigate to other result pages using the page navigation under the search menu.
