The Recommendation Engine consists of two parts: a batch process that performs the analysis and a service for reading recommendations from the database. 

While both parts are installed by default for simple setups, it is generally advisable to install the batch process part in a separate, non-delivery CAE when setting up a live deployment. In this scenario, the delivery CAEs will only contain the service part of the Recommendation Engine. Section describes how to remove the Recommendation Engine from a CAE.

The sections below cover the configuration of the Recommendation Engine.
