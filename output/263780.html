(There is one exception to this rule: see below.)</p><p>The running time correlates roughly linearly to the sum of the following factors:</p><ul><li>(number of ratings) × (value of <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.user.small.rating.count</span>)</li><li>(number of users) × (value of <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.user.moderate.correlation.count</span>)</li><li>(number of ratings) × (value of <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.item.small.rating.count</span>)</li><li>(number of items) × (value of <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.item.moderate.correlation.count</span>)</li></ul><p>The calculation running time is thus generally linear to the number of ratings. This is achieved by using a probabilistic algorithm for treating users who rate very often and for items that are very often rated.</p><p>Note that t<span xml:lang="EN-US">he properties </span><span class="inlineformat--code" xml:lang="EN-US">recommend.flow.user.large.rating.count</span><span xml:lang="EN-US"> and </span><span class="inlineformat--code" xml:lang="EN-US">recommend.flow.item.large.rating.count</span><span xml:lang="EN-US"> also influence the running time by disallowing the evaluation of users who rated more often than the parameter value and items that received more ratings than the specified parameter value. However, not only are both of these occurrences rare, but the contribution of the underlying main memory algorithm to the total running time is also normally negligible. The </span><span class="inlineformat--code" xml:lang="EN-US">*.large.*</span><span xml:lang="EN-US"> parameters are thus not listed above and are provided for tuning in exceptional cases only.</span></p><p>The <span class="inlineformat--code">*.half.correlation.count</span> properties do not influence the running time. Instead, they determine how strongly a high number of commonly rated items or commonly rating users improves the correlation between two users or items. A low number indicates that a high similarity can be achieved by a precise agreement on only a few data points.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.user.max.similar</span> property defines the maximum number of users similar to the current user, which are used for generating recommendations for the current user<span class="inlineformat--code">. </span>This number influences the recommendations calculated. The property<span class="inlineformat--code"> recommend.flow.item.max.similar </span>defines the maximum number of items calculated as similar to one item.</p><p>The <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.max.recommendations</span> properties determines the maximum number of recommendations generated and stored for a single user.</p><p>The <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.filepool.*</span> properties are used to configure how intermediate results of the <em>Recommendation Engine</em> are stored on disk. <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.filepool.buckets</span> specifies the number of separate files used. This is relevant in case the amount of data that is to be stored is larger than the maximum allowed file size. <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.filepool.buffer </span>determines the size of the i/o-Buffer used when reading from and writing to files.</p><p><span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.execution.nthreads</span> sets the maximum number of threads that are used to compute recommendations. The effect of using multiple threads is determined by the number and load of the available processors as well as the number of files used to implement pools as determined by <span class="inlineformat--code">recommend.flow.filepool.buckets -</span> the more files there are the more data can be read and written in parallel, but if there are too many files, the i/o-overhead outweighs the gains of concurrent processing.</p><p>The properties are described in more detail in the table below.<br/></p></div>
