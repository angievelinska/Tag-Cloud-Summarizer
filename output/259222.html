Similarly, the content type of a blob property may not be changed in subtypes of the type declaring the property.</p><p>The <span class="inlineformat--code">Resource</span> interface has an additional property <span class="font-name--courier">UUID</span>, which is a read-only, stable, and universally unique identifier of the resource.</p><p>Relationships are defined as a bidirectional link between two resources. A relationship has a <em>source</em> and a <em>target</em>, each of which is restricted to a <span class="inlineformat--code">ResourceType</span>. In the meta model (the <span class="inlineformat--code">RelationshipType</span>), the two endpoints of a relationship are represented as the source <span class="inlineformat--code">Role</span> and target <span class="inlineformat--code">Role</span>. Roles may be unspecified in abstract relationship types, but once a relationship type declares roles, they may not be overridden by subtypes.</p></div>
